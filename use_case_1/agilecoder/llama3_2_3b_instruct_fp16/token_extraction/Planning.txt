2. The product successfully runs without any errors,
3. The product is be designed for ease of use,
4. The product has a full of manual and relevant documentation.
To achieve your goal, you must write a response based on your needs.]

Let's discuss the product modality for the new customer's task: "Create a snake game in Python".

I think we should consider creating an Application, as it would allow us to implement a visualized game with interactive features, such as arrow key controls and animations.

What are your thoughts on this option? Do you have any other suggestions for product modality that could be suitable for this task?

**Product Backlog**

$PRODUCT_BACKLOG

1. **Create a Grid-Based Game Board**
	* As a user, I want to see a 10x10 grid-based game board displayed on the screen.
	* The grid should have clear boundaries and be visible in different environments (e.g., light or dark background).
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The game board is displayed with 10 rows and 10 columns.
		+ The grid has clear boundaries (top, bottom, left, right).
2. **Implement Snake Initialization**
	* As a user, I want the snake to be placed on the game board at a random starting position.
	* The initial length of the snake should be 5 segments.
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The snake is randomly positioned within the grid (x and y coordinates).
		+ The initial length of the snake is 5 segments.
3. **Implement Snake Movement**
	* As a user, I want to control the snake using arrow keys.
	* The snake should move continuously in the chosen direction until it collides with an obstacle or reaches the end of the grid.
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The snake moves in response to arrow key presses (up, down, left, right).
		+ The snake does not move when no keys are pressed.
4. **Generate Food at Random Positions**
	* As a user, I want food to be generated at random positions within the grid.
	* Food should not appear on the snake's body.
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ Food is randomly generated with x and y coordinates within the grid.
		+ Food does not appear on the snake's body.
5. **Implement Collision Handling**
	* As a user, I want the game to detect collisions between the snake and obstacles (grid boundaries and its own body).
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The game detects collisions with grid boundaries (top, bottom, left, right).
		+ The game detects collisions between the snake's head and its own body.
6. **Implement Snake Growth**
	* As a user, I want the snake to grow when it consumes food.
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ When the snake eats food, a new segment is added to its body.
7. **Display Score**
	* As a user, I want my current score displayed on the screen.
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The current score is updated in real-time when the snake eats food or collides with an obstacle.
8. **Implement Game Over Condition**
	* As a user, I want the game to end when the snake collides with obstacles (grid boundaries and its own body).
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ The game ends when the snake collides with grid boundaries or its own body.
9. **Create User-Friendly Interface**
	* As a user, I want clear instructions displayed on the screen to help me understand how to play the game.
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ Clear instructions are displayed on the screen (e.g., "Use arrow keys to control the snake").
10. **Add Animations and Effects**
	* As a user, I want visual effects for collisions and food consumption (e.g., animations for snake movement and growth).
	* Acceptance Criteria:
		+ Visual effects are added for collisions and food consumption.

Note that advanced features like AI and sounds will not be implemented in this initial version of the game.

After reviewing the product backlog, I have identified a potential issue that requires attention.

**Comment with the highest priority:**

The current product backlog does not address how to handle game over conditions when the snake collides with its own body. This is a critical aspect of the game, as it directly impacts the gameplay experience and user satisfaction.

**Corresponding suggestions on revision:**

To fix this issue, I recommend revising task #5 "Implement Collision Handling" to include sub-tasks that cover collision detection between the snake's head and its own body. Specifically, we should add a new task:

* **Sub-task 5.1:** Implement collision detection between the snake's head and its own body.
* This sub-task will require us to update the game logic to detect when the snake collides with its own tail, triggering a game over scenario.

**Revised product backlog:**

Here is the revised product backlog:

Product backlog:
"1. **Create a Grid-Based Game Board**
2. **Implement Snake Initialization**
3. **Implement Snake Movement**
4. **Generate Food at Random Positions**
5. **Implement Collision Handling (including sub-task 5.1)**
6. **Implement Snake Growth**
7. **Display Score**
8. **Implement Game Over Condition**
9. **Create User-Friendly Interface**
10. **Add Animations and Effects"

By addressing this issue, we can ensure that the game over condition is handled correctly, providing a more seamless gameplay experience for users.
