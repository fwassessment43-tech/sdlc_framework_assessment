
[You are a client. You employ AgileCoder, a software development company, to develop a product based on the following task description: # Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
You also require AgileCoder to obey the following requirements:
1. The proposed features can be implementable,
2. The product successfully runs without any errors,
3. The product is be designed for ease of use,
4. The product has a full of manual and relevant documentation.
To achieve your goal, you must write a response based on your needs.]

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to your request, I am pleased to respond that we have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via Python.


<PYTHON>

I'm glad you're excited about using Python for this task! Let's start by creating a new Python script and setting up the basic structure of our code. This will include defining the dimensions of the game board, initializing the snake's position and direction, and implementing collision detection and scoring systems.

Once we have these basics in place, we can start thinking about adding some more advanced features such as food generation, snake growth, and user input handling. We may also want to consider adding animations and visual effects for a more engaging gameplay experience.

Remember, it's important to break the task down into smaller, manageable steps and to take breaks as needed to avoid burnout. Good luck with your project!
