### Product Backlog:

1. **Create a Grid-Based Game Board with Dimensions (10x10)**
   - Develop a 2D grid-based game board using Python's `grid` library or simple arrays.
   - Implement methods to display the grid on the screen.

2. **Initialize Snake Position and Movement**
   - Place the snake at the center of the grid with an initial length (e.g., 3 segments).
   - Set a direction for the snake’s movement (right by default) using arrow keys.
   - Add logic to handle continuous movement in the chosen direction.

3. **Generate Food on the Game Board**
   - Randomly generate food positions within the game board, ensuring it does not overlap with the snake's body.
   - Display food visually or as a special character on the grid.

4. **Snake Movement via Arrow Keys Controls**
   - Implement functions to handle arrow key input and update the snake’s position accordingly.
   - Ensure continuous movement based on the initially chosen direction without user input.

5. **Collision Detection with Game Board Boundaries, Snake Body, and Food**
   - Detect collisions between the snake’s head and boundaries of the game board.
   - Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its own body or segments.
   - Handle collisions with food by increasing snake length and displaying a message indicating successful consumption.

6. **Score Display System**
   - Maintain a score counter that increases upon consuming food.
   - Update the score display on the screen every frame or after each move.

7. **Game Over Conditions and Restart Functionality**
   - Detect and trigger game over scenarios when snake collides with boundaries, body, or food.
   - Display a game over message, clear the grid, reset scores, and provide an option to restart.

8. **Graphics and User Interface Design**
   - Implement ASCII art for the snake and food to create a user-friendly interface.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to control the snake using arrow keys.

9. **Animations and Effects**
   - Add animations when the snake moves and grows.
   - Apply visual effects such as growth animation, collision flashes, and successful food consumption notifications.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Grid-Based Game Board**:
   - The game board is a 10x10 grid displayed on the screen using ASCII characters.
   - Snake position updates are displayed on the grid without any visible gaps or interruptions during continuous movement.

2. **Snake Initialization and Movement**:
   - The snake starts at the center of the grid with an initial length of 3 segments.
   - Arrow keys control the snake’s direction, ensuring it moves continuously in the chosen direction without user input.
   - Snake position updates are visible on the game board during continuous movement.

3. **Food Generation**:
   - Food is generated randomly within the game board dimensions and positioned such that it does not overlap with the snake's body.
   - The food position is displayed using ASCII characters to represent a special character or symbol on the grid.

4. **Snake Movement Control via Arrow Keys**:
   - User can control the snake’s movement using arrow keys (left, right, up, down).
   - Changes in direction are applied immediately and continuously without user input.
   - The snake's position updates and directions are displayed accurately within the game board limits.

5. **Collision Detection with Game Board Boundaries**:
   - When the snake collides with the top or bottom boundaries of the grid, a game over message is triggered.
   - If the snake collides with its own body (head), a game over message is also triggered.
   - On detecting collisions with food, score increases and a consumption message appears.

6. **Score Display System**:
   - The player's score is incremented by one after consuming food.
   - The score display on the screen updates every frame or upon each move.

7. **Game Over Conditions**:
   - When the snake collides with any of the game board boundaries, a message "GAME OVER" is displayed.
   - On collision with its own body, the same "GAME OVER" message is shown.
   - The grid and score are reset to their initial state or default values.

8. **Graphics and User Interface Design**:
   - The snake and food positions are represented using ASCII characters for a clear and simple interface.
   - The game board is easily identifiable as a 10x10 grid, with both boundaries clearly visible and distinct from the grid lines.

9. **Animations and Effects**:
   - When the snake moves, it appears to move smoothly along the defined path without gaps or interruptions.
   - Visual effects for collisions include flashes of color on food consumption and a different pattern when the player is moving their direction incorrectly.

10. **Restart Functionality**:
    - A restart button/option allows players to start the game anew from the initial state.
    - The grid, score, and snake position are reset upon initiating a new game.

By adhering to these steps and criteria, we ensure that each feature of the snake game is implemented correctly, leading to an intuitive and engaging experience for users.
