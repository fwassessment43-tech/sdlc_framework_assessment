
This will scan the current directory for Python files, determine the required packages based on the imports, and write them to a requirements.txt file. 

However, since `random` is a built-in module and does not need to be installed separately, we do not need to include it in our requirements.txt file.

Here's an explanation of how the above requirements.txt content was decided upon:
1. **Pygame**: The project clearly uses Pygame for game development. Therefore, Pygame must be included as a dependency.
2. **No other dependencies**: Besides Pygame, there are no other external libraries used in the code that need to be installed separately.

In conclusion, based on the provided codes and file formats listed above, we can use the following requirements.txt content:
