Here is a new customer's task: # Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]


1. main.py: This is the entry point of the program. It will import the necessary files and create the game board, snake, and food objects. The main function will also handle user input and control the game loop.
```python
import pygame
from game_board import GameBoard
from snake import Snake
from food import Food

# Initialize pygame
pygame.init()

# Create game board, snake, and food objects
board = GameBoard(10, 10)
snake = Snake(board, [5, 5], 'right')
food = Food(board, [7, 7])

# Set up the screen
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((board.width * board.block_size, board.height * board.block_size))
pygame.display.set_caption('Snake Game')

# Define colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)

# Main game loop
while True:
    # Handle user input
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                snake.move('left')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                snake.move('right')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                snake.move('up')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                snake.move('down')

    # Update game objects and display the game board
    snake.update()
    food.spawn()
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    board.draw(screen, WHITE)
    pygame.display.flip()
```
2. game_board.py: This file contains the GameBoard class that represents the game board. It has a width and height attribute and a block_size attribute that determines the size of each block on the game board. The class also has a draw method that displays the game board on the screen.
```python
import pygame
from constants import *

class GameBoard:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.block_size = 20

    def draw(self, screen, color):
        for y in range(self.height):
            for x in range(self.width):
                pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, (x * self.block_size, y * self.block_size, self.block_size, self.block_size))
```
3. snake.py: This file contains the Snake class that represents the snake in the game. It has a head and tail attribute that stores the position of the snake's head and tail respectively. The class also has a move method that moves the snake one block in the chosen direction, and an update method that updates the snake's position on the game board.
```python
import pygame
from game_board import GameBoard
from food import Food
from constants import *

class Snake:
    def __init__(self, board, start_position, direction):
        self.board = board
        self.head = start_position
        self.tail = start_position
        self.direction = direction

    def move(self, direction):
        if direction == 'left':
            self.head[0] -= 1
        elif direction == 'right':
            self.head[0] += 1
        elif direction == 'up':
            self.head[1] -= 1
        elif direction == 'down':
            self.head[1] += 1

    def update(self):
        self.tail = self.head
        if self.direction == 'left':
            self.head[0] += 1
        elif self.direction == 'right':
            self.head[0] -= 1
        elif self.direction == 'up':
            self.head[1] += 1
        elif self.direction == 'down':
            self.head[1] -= 1

    def is_collision(self, food):
        return (food.x == self.head[0] and food.y == self.head[1]) or (food.x == self.tail[0] and food.y == self.tail[1])
```
4. food.py: This file contains the Food class that represents the food in the game. It has an x and y attribute that stores the position of the food on the game board, and a spawn method that generates a new position for the food.
```python
import pygame
from game_board import GameBoard
from constants import *

class Food:
    def __init__(self, board, start_position):
        self.board = board
        self.x = start_position[0]
        self.y = start_position[1]

    def spawn(self):
        valid_positions = []
        for y in range(self.board.height):
            for x in range(self.board.width):
                if (x, y) not in self.board.snake.body:
                    valid_positions.append((x, y))
        if valid_positions:
            self.x, self.y = random.choice(valid_positions)
        else:
            print('No valid food positions left!')
```
5. constants.py: This file contains constants that are used in the program such as colors, font sizes, and game settings.
```python
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
BLOCK_SIZE = 20
FONT_NAME = 'Arial'
FONT_SIZE = 24
SPEED = 15
```
