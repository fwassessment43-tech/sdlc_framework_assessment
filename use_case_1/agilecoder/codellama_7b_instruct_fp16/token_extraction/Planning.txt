Regulation 1: Considering the proficiency of the members, all the tasks are feasible and finished by at least one member.
Comment: I would suggest adding some additional tasks to the product backlog to ensure that each member has a chance to contribute to the project. For example, you could add tasks such as creating a game over screen or implementing a high score system. This will not only help to distribute workload more evenly among team members but also encourage them to take ownership of their tasks and make meaningful contributions to the project.
Suggestions for revision:
1. Add new tasks that require different skills sets from the team members.
2. Ensure that each task is well-defined and has a clear start and end date.
3. Assign appropriate complexity levels to each task based on the expertise of the team members.
4. Establish a clear communication plan for sharing progress updates, issues, and deadlines among team members.
5. Define roles and responsibilities for each member in the project to ensure that everyone understands their tasks and can work independently without conflicts or overlaps.
6. Create a project management tool like Trello or Asana to track progress, manage tasks, and collaborate with the team.
