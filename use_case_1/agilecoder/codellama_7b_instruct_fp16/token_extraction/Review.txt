Comment: <INFO> The snake's body is not updated properly in the move method of the Snake class.

Suggestion: Update the tail variable with the new head position after updating the direction and then update the head variable to the new position. This will ensure that the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.

In the modified codes, we have addressed the following issues:

* The snake moves correctly based on user input.
* The food is spawned correctly in a random position that is not occupied by the snake's body.
* The game board is displayed correctly with the correct size and color.
* The main game loop continues until the game is exited.

Overall, these modifications ensure that the software creative, executive, and robust, and resolves the sprint backlog.

<INFO> High Priority: The code seems to be well-structured, but there are some areas that require improvement. Firstly, the main game loop in main.py could benefit from a clearer separation of concerns between the event handling and game logic. As it stands, the event handling code is still embedded in the main loop, which makes it difficult to test and maintain. It would be better to extract the event handling code into its own function or class, so that we can focus on just the game logic in the main loop.

Secondly, the snake's movement could benefit from a more robust collision detection system. Currently, the snake only checks for collisions with the game boundaries when it moves to a new cell. However, this does not take into account the possibility of the snake intersecting with its own body or colliding with food cells that are already occupied by the snake's body. A more comprehensive collision detection system would help prevent these types of errors from occurring and improve the overall stability and robustness of the game.

Lastly, it would be helpful to add some visual cues to indicate when a snake consumes food or grows in length. For example, we could display a brief flash animation when the snake collides with food, or update the score display whenever the snake eats food. These types of visual cues can help make the game more engaging and rewarding for players.

Instructions: Please extract the event handling code from the main loop in main.py into its own function or class. Implement a robust collision detection system that accounts for all possible collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries, as well as collisions with the snake's body and food cells. Add some visual cues to indicate when a snake consumes food or grows in length. Finally, ensure that the software runs smoothly and without any errors. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any of these points, please let me know.

As a Code Reviewer, I have reviewed the provided Python code for the snake game project and provide this comment with the highest priority:

"<WARNING> Inconsistent naming conventions throughout the code. It is recommended to use a consistent naming convention throughout the code to make it easier to read and understand."

Here are some suggestions on how to fix this issue:

1. Use a consistent naming convention throughout the code. For example, use snake_case for variable names, CamelCase for class names, and PascalCase for constant names.
2. Check the code for any inconsistencies in the naming conventions and make sure to fix them.
3. Document the code using docstrings to explain what each function does and how it works.
4. Use a linter tool like pylint or pyflakes to check for naming convention violations and other errors.
5. Review the code again after making the changes suggested above and ensure that all the regulations mentioned in the previous message are followed.

- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]
