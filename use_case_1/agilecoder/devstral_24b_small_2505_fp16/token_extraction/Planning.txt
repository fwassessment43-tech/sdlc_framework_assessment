You also require AgileCoder to obey the following requirements:
1. The proposed features can be implementable,
2. The product successfully runs without any errors,
3. The product is be designed for ease of use,
4. The product has a full of manual and relevant documentation.
To achieve your goal, you must write a response based on your needs.]

I believe that for this particular task, creating an "Application" using Python would be the most suitable product modality. The requirements clearly indicate that we need to develop a functional game, which is best suited as an application.
