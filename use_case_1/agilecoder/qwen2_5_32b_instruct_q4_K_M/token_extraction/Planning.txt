Given that the task involves creating a snake game in Python, it's clear that we're looking to develop an application. The nature of the requirement is interactive and requires user input for controls like arrow keys, which aligns perfectly with developing an application rather than any other form such as documents or presentations.

Let's confirm this understanding. Since the task specifies creating a game (which inherently involves dynamic interaction), the most suitable modality for our product would be an Application developed in Python to meet these requirements effectively.

<INFO> Finished

Based on the provided regulations and the user's task description, the proposed product backlog appears to be in alignment with the requirements specified by the customer. The tasks are feasible given our team’s expertise, do not include any enhanced features that were not explicitly mentioned (such as AI), and focus primarily on the core functionalities of a Snake game including grid-based movement, food generation, collision handling, snake growth, and score display. Additionally, the inclusion of basic animations is permissible under the user's task requirement for visual effects.

Therefore, no revisions are necessary at this time, adhering to both feasibility and specification boundaries set by our regulations.
