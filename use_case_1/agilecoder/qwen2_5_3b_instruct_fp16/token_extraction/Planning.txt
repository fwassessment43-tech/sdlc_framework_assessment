### Product Backlog:

1. **Create Game Board**
   - Develop a grid-based game board with dimensions (e.g., 10x10).
   - Display the grid on the screen.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Grid should be visible and correctly sized.

2. **Initialize Snake**
   - Place the snake on the game board.
   - Define initial length and starting position of the snake.
   - Choose a direction for the snake to move (e.g., right) without user input.
   - Acceptance Criteria: The snake should appear on the grid in its initial position and move according to the chosen direction.

3. **Implement Snake Movement with Arrow Key Controls**
   - Implement arrow key controls for moving the snake.
   - Ensure continuous movement of the snake in the chosen direction.
   - Update the snake's position on the grid.
   - Acceptance Criteria: The player should be able to control the snake using arrow keys and observe continuous movement.

4. **Generate Food at Random Positions**
   - Generate food at random positions on the game board without overlapping with the snake’s body.
   - Ensure the food appears correctly on the grid.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Food should appear randomly but not overlap with the snake's segments.

5. **Detect Collisions and Implement Game Over Conditions**
   - Detect collisions between the snake and boundaries of the game board.
   - Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its own body.
   - Trigger a game over scenario when either condition is met.
   - Display a game over message.
   - Allow players to restart the game after a game over.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Game should end with appropriate messages on collision.

6. **Score System**
   - Implement a scoring system that tracks snake length and updates in real-time.
   - Display the current score on the screen.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Score should update correctly during gameplay and display at the game’s start.

7. **Graphics and User Interface Design**
   - Use ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
   - Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
   - Ensure readability and aesthetics of the game board, snake, and score.
   - Acceptance Criteria: UI should be visually appealing and easy to understand.

8. **Animations for Snake Movement and Growth**
   - Add animations for snake movement (e.g., smooth transitions when changing direction).
   - Implement visual effects for growth (e.g., new segments appearing smoothly).
   - Ensure animations are seamless.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Animations should be visually engaging without slowing down the game.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Game Board Creation**:
   - The grid-based game board is correctly sized and displayed on the screen.
   - Each cell in the grid can display an ASCII character (e.g., `#` for boundaries).

2. **Snake Initialization**:
   - The snake starts at a specific position with initial length defined by the user or hardcoded values.
   - The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.

3. **Arrow Key Controls Implementation**:
   - Arrow keys are recognized and the snake moves accordingly.
   - Movement is smooth without juddering or lagging.

4. **Food Generation**:
   - Food appears at random positions on the grid, avoiding overlap with the snake’s body.
   - Food can be represented by a different ASCII character (e.g., `*`).

5. **Collision Detection and Game Over Conditions**:
   - The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body.
   - A game over message is displayed, along with the option to restart.

6. **Score System**:
   - Score updates as the length of the snake increases (e.g., +1 for each new segment).
   - The score is clearly displayed on the screen.

7. **User Interface Design**:
   - An intuitive and visually appealing interface is designed.
   - Clear instructions are provided to guide players through the game.

8. **Animations**:
   - Snake movement has smooth transitions between directions.
   - New segments appear smoothly when growing.
   - Visual effects for collisions and food consumption enhance gameplay experience.

By prioritizing these product backlog items, we ensure that each feature is implemented in a logical order, starting with basic requirements like the game board and snake initialization, moving to more complex features such as collision detection and animations. This approach allows us to build confidence step-by-step while delivering value to the user.
