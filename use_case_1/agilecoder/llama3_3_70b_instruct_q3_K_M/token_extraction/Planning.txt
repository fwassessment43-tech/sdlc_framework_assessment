Considering the requirements for the snake game, I think an Application modality would be most suitable, as it would allow us to create an interactive game with visualizations and animations. However, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this before making a final decision. Should we consider other modalities, such as Website or Dashboard, or do you also think Application is the way to go?

After reviewing the product backlog, my comment with the highest priority is that task 10 **Basic Animations** may incorporate enhanced features like animations which are not explicitly specified in the user's task.

To fix this issue, I suggest revising task 10 to focus only on the basic representation of the snake and food using ASCII characters, without adding any animation effects. The revised task 10 could be:
"10. **Graphics and Representation**: Use ASCII characters to represent the snake and food, designing a user-friendly interface with clear instructions."

This revision ensures that the product backlog adheres to the regulations by not incorporating enhanced features unless explicitly specified in the user's task.

Based on the provided comments and requirements, I have revised the product backlog to ensure it adheres to the regulations and meets the user's demands. Here is the updated product backlog:

1. **Game Board Setup**: Create a 10x10 grid-based game board and display it on the screen.
2. **Snake Initialization**: Place the snake on the game board with an initial length of 3 units, starting from the top-left corner, and moving right immediately.
3. **Snake Movement**: Implement arrow key controls for snake movement, ensuring continuous movement in the chosen direction.
4. **Food Generation**: Generate food at random positions on the game board, avoiding overlap with the snake's body.
5. **Collision Handling**: Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries, the snake's head and its body, and the snake's head and the food.
6. **Snake Growth**: Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake's body.
7. **Score Display**: Implement a scoring system, displaying the current score on the screen.
8. **Game Over Condition**: Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with boundaries or its own body, displaying a game over message and allowing restart.
9. **Graphics and User Interface**: Use ASCII characters to represent the snake and food, designing a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
10. **Graphics and Representation**: Use ASCII characters to represent the snake and food, designing a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.

This revised product backlog ensures that we are only implementing the features explicitly specified in the user's task, without adding any enhanced features unless explicitly requested. The updated task 10 now focuses solely on using ASCII characters for representation, without incorporating animations.

To implement this product backlog, we will create multiple Python files to organize the code and ensure it is maintainable and efficient. We will use object-oriented programming principles to define classes for the game board, snake, food, and scoring system. The main game loop will handle user input, update the game state, and render the game board.

Here's a high-level overview of how we can structure our code:

* `game_board.py`: Define the GameBoard class, responsible for creating and displaying the 10x10 grid.
* `snake.py`: Define the Snake class, handling snake movement, growth, and collision detection.
* `food.py`: Define the Food class, generating food at random positions on the game board.
* `scoring_system.py`: Implement the scoring system, displaying the current score on the screen.
* `game_loop.py`: Handle user input, update the game state, and render the game board.
* `main.py`: Initialize the game and start the main game loop.

By following this structure and implementing each feature as specified in the product backlog, we can create a robust and executable snake game that meets the user's demands.
