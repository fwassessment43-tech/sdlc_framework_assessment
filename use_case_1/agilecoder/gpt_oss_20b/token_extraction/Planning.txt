**Product Backlog**

| # | Backlog Item (Epic / Story) | Priority | Description | Effort (Story Points) |
|---|-----------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| **1** | **Core Game Engine** | ★★★★★ | Implement the main game loop that drives the Snake game, including timing, frame updates, and event handling. | 5 |
| **2** | **Grid‑Based Board** | ★★★★★ | Create a 10x10 grid data structure, render it to the console, and ensure each cell can hold snake segments or food. | 3 |
| **3** | **Snake Data Model** | ★★★★★ | Define the snake as a list of coordinate pairs, initialize with a default length and starting position (center‑right), and set the initial movement direction to the right. | 3 |
| **4** | **Snake Movement** | ★★★★★ | Handle arrow‑key input, update the snake’s head position each tick, and shift body segments accordingly. | 4 |
| **5** | **Continuous Movement** | ★★★★☆ | After an initial direction is set, keep the snake moving automatically until a key press changes direction. | 2 |
| **6** | **Food Generation** | ★★★★☆ | Randomly place food on empty grid cells, ensuring it never spawns on the snake’s body. | 3 |
| **7** | **Collision Detection** | ★★★★☆ | Detect head collisions with board boundaries, self‑collision, and food collision. | 4 |

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Core Game Engine (Item 1)**
   - The program enters a continuous loop that updates the display at least 10 fps.
   - The loop correctly processes user input, updates the snake, checks collisions, and renders the board each tick.
   - The loop can be gracefully exited by pressing `Ctrl+C` or the exit key.

2. **Grid‑Based Board (Item 2)**
   - The board is represented internally as a 10×10 grid.
   - The console displays a clear grid where each cell is either empty, part of the snake, or contains food.
   - The board updates correctly after each snake movement.

3. **Snake Data Model (Item 3)**
   - At game start, the snake occupies 3 consecutive cells horizontally with its head at the rightmost cell.
   - The initial direction is right; the snake moves automatically without user input for the first tick.

4. **Snake Movement (Item 4) & Continuous Movement (Item 5)**
   - Arrow keys (`←`, `→`, `↑`, `↓`) change the snake’s direction immediately.
   - The snake continues moving in the current direction each tick until a new direction is input.
   - The snake cannot reverse direction directly (e.g., from right to left).

5. **Food Generation (Item 6)**
   - Food appears at a random grid cell that is not occupied by the snake.
   - When the snake eats food, the food disappears and a new food appears immediately.

6. **Collision Detection (Item 7)**
   - If the snake’s head reaches the grid boundary, the game over condition triggers.
   - If the snake’s head collides with any part of its body, the game over condition triggers.
   - If the snake’s head reaches a cell containing food, the snake grows and the score increases.

7. **Snake Growth (Item 8)**
   - After eating food, the snake’s length increases by one segment, which appears at the former tail position on the next update.
   - The growth is visually represented on the board.

8. **Scoring System (Item 9)**
   - Each food consumption increments the score by 1.
   - The current score is displayed prominently at the top of the console.

9. **Game Over Handling (Item 10) & Restart Mechanism (Item 11)**
   - Upon collision, a “Game Over” message is shown with the final score.
   - The message includes instructions to press `R` to restart.
   - Pressing `R` resets the board, snake, score, and starts the game loop anew.

10. **ASCII UI & Instructions (Item 12)**
    - Snake segments are rendered with a distinct character (e.g., `█`).
    - Food is rendered with a distinct character (e.g., `●`).
    - Empty cells are rendered with a space or `.`.
    - The top of the screen shows: `Score: X | Use arrow keys to move | Press R to restart |`

11. **Basic Animations & Effects (Item 13)**
    - On food consumption, the food cell briefly changes color (if supported) or displays a flash.
    - On collision, the offending cell flashes red before showing the game‑over screen.

12. **Unit & Integration Tests (Item 14)**
    - Tests verify that food never spawns on the snake.
    - Tests confirm collision detection logic for boundaries, self‑collision, and food.
    - Tests confirm that snake grows correctly and score increments.

13. **Code Review & Refactor (Item 15)**
    - All modules follow a single‑responsibility principle.
    - Code is documented with docstrings and comments where necessary.
    - No hard‑coded magic numbers; configuration values (grid size, initial snake length) are constants.

14. **Packaging & Execution Script (Item 16)**
    - Running `python run.py` starts the game on supported terminals.
    - The script handles missing dependencies gracefully and provides an informative error message.
