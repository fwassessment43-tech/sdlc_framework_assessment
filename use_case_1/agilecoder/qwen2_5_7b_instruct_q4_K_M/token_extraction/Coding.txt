Here is a new customer's task: # Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

### Step 1: Define Core Classes and Functions

To satisfy the sprint goals, we will define the following core classes and functions:

- **Snake**: Manages the snake's position, movement, growth, and collision detection.
- **GameBoard**: Manages the game board state, including displaying the grid and handling food generation.
- **MainApp**: The main application class that integrates all components and handles user input.

### Step 2: File Layout

1. `main.py`: Main entry point of the application.
2. `game_board.py`: Handles the game board logic.
3. `snake.py`: Manages the snake's behavior.
4. `utils.py`: Utility functions for various operations (e.g., random number generation).

### Step 3: Code Implementation

### Explanation:

- **main.py**: Initializes Pygame and sets up the game window. It creates an instance of `GameBoard` and `Snake`, and enters a main loop to handle events and update the state.
- **game_board.py**: Manages the drawing of the game board and generating food.
- **snake.py**: Manages the snake's movement, collision detection with food, and growth.
- **utils.py**: Provides utility functions like random position generation.

This setup lays down the foundational components required to implement a basic snake game in Python using Pygame.
