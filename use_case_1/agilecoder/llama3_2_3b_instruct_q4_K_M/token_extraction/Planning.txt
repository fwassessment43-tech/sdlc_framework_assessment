After reviewing the product backlog, I have identified several tasks that can be improved or refined to ensure they are feasible and aligned with our team's expertise.

**Comment with highest priority:**

The **Snake Growth** task (task #6) might be challenging to implement correctly without proper guidance on how to handle snake segment addition and removal. To avoid potential issues, I suggest rephrasing this task to focus on implementing a basic mechanism for growing the snake by adding a new segment when food is consumed, rather than specifying the exact implementation details.

**Proposed revision:**

Task #6: **Snake Growth**
Revised task description: "Implement a basic mechanism for growing the snake by adding a new segment when food is consumed."

**Instructions on how to fix:**

1. Refine the revised task description to ensure it clearly communicates the expected outcome.
2. Review and discuss the revised task with your team members to ensure everyone understands the changes.

Overall, the product backlog appears well-structured, and with this revision, we can move forward with implementing the snake growth feature while maintaining a focus on feasibility and clarity.
