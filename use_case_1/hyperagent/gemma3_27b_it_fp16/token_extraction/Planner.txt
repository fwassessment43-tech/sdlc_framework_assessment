This is a large task encompassing a full game implementation. I'll break it down into manageable steps, starting with the core game board and snake initialization. I’ll start by having the intern generate a basic framework with the board and snake, without any movement or interaction. This will give me a foundation to build upon. I will use the Codebase Navigator to understand the existing structure and then ask the Codebase Editor to create a new file containing the initial framework.

Intern Name: Codebase Navigator
Subgoal: Please analyze the repository and identify existing files related to game development or graphics. If there are no relevant files, confirm that this is a new project. Also, identify the preferred coding style and any existing project structure. If no structure is present, suggest a suitable one for a game like this (e.g., separate files for game logic, rendering, input handling). Report your findings.

The navigator confirmed that this is a new project. Now, I’ll instruct the Codebase Editor to create the basic file structure and initial classes for the snake and food. I’ll start with empty classes for `snake.py` and `food.py` to provide a foundation for adding functionality later. I'll also create `game.py` with a basic structure for the main game loop.  This will get the project skeleton in place.

Intern Name: Codebase Editor
Subgoal: Please create the following files and initial classes within a directory named `snake_game`:

1.  `snake_game/snake.py`:
    ```python
    class Snake:
        def __init__(self):
            pass  # Initialize snake properties here

        def move(self):
            pass  # Implement snake movement logic

        def grow(self):
            pass  # Implement snake growth logic
    ```

2.  `snake_game/food.py`:
    ```python
    class Food:
        def __init__(self):
            pass  # Initialize food properties here

        def generate(self):
            pass  # Implement food generation logic
    ```

3.  `snake_game/game.py`:
    ```python
    import snake
    import food

    def main():
        # Initialize game elements
        snake = snake.Snake()
        food = food.Food()

        # Game loop
        while True:
            # Update game state
            # Render game elements
            # Handle user input
            pass

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

Please ensure the files are created with the exact content provided and the correct directory structure. Don’t include any additional content or comments.

The editor successfully created the files and directory structure. Now, I need to start implementing the core game logic. I’ll start with the `Snake` class and add basic properties like the initial position, length, and direction. I’ll also add a method to move the snake one step in the current direction. I'll ask the Codebase Editor to modify the `snake.py` file to include these changes.

Intern Name: Codebase Editor
Subgoal: Please modify the `snake_game/snake.py` file as follows:

```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = [(0, 0)]  # Initial position
        self.length = 1  # Initial length
        self.direction = "right"  # Initial direction

    def move(self):
        head_x, head_y = self.position[0]

        if self.direction == "right":
            new_head = (head_x + 1, head_y)
        elif self.direction == "left":
            new_head = (head_x - 1, head_y)
        elif self.direction == "up":
            new_head = (head_x, head_y - 1)
        elif self.direction == "down":
            new_head = (head_x, head_y + 1)

        self.position.insert(0, new_head)  # Add new head
        self.position.pop()  # Remove tail
```

Please replace the existing content of `snake.py` with this new code. Do not add any extra content or comments.

The editor is consistently failing to modify the file, reporting that it cannot find the file despite successful creation attempts. This suggests a fundamental issue with the environment or the editor’s ability to interact with the file system. Since the editor is unable to reliably modify the files, I need to reassess the approach. I'll switch to focusing on the game logic conceptually and defer actual code implementation until a stable environment is available.

I will ask the Codebase Navigator to provide a high-level outline of the remaining tasks required to complete the snake game, assuming the files are editable. This will help me maintain a clear plan even though I cannot currently execute the code changes.

Intern Name: Codebase Navigator
Subgoal: Please provide a detailed, step-by-step outline of the remaining tasks required to complete the snake game, assuming we have reliable file editing capabilities. Include specific functionality that needs to be implemented in each file (`snake.py`, `food.py`, `game.py`) and any additional files that might be needed (e.g., for rendering or input handling). Focus on the logical steps involved, not the actual code implementation.

The navigator provided a comprehensive outline of the remaining tasks, breaking them down by file and functionality. It also highlighted the need for separate files for rendering, input handling, and configuration, which is a good design practice. I'll now create a more detailed plan for implementing these tasks, outlining the specific steps and considerations for each file.

**I. `snake.py` - Snake Logic**

1.  **Data Structures:** Define the snake's body as a list of (x, y) coordinates. The head will be the first element, and the tail will be the last.
2.  **Initialization:**  Implement an `__init__` method to initialize the snake's body, starting position, length, and direction.
3.  **Movement:** Implement a `move()` method that updates the snake's body based on its current direction.  Add the new head position and remove the tail segment.
4.  **Growth:** Implement a `grow()` method that adds a new segment to the snake's body *without* removing the tail segment.  This method will be called when the snake eats food.
5.  **Collision Detection:** Implement methods to detect collisions with the game boundaries and with the snake itself. Return `True` if a collision occurs, `False` otherwise.
6.  **Direction Change:** Implement a method to change the snake's direction based on user input. Prevent immediate reversal.

**II. `food.py` - Food Logic**

1.  **Data Structures:** Define the food's position as (x, y) coordinates.
2.  **Initialization:** Implement an `__init__` method to initialize the food's position.
3.  **Random Generation:** Implement a `generate()` method to randomly place the food within the game boundaries, ensuring it doesn't overlap with the snake's body.
4.  **Repositioning:** Implement a method to reposition the food after it has been eaten.

**III. `game.py` - Game Management**

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize the game window, set up the game boundaries, create instances of the `Snake` and `Food` classes, and initialize the score.
2.  **Game Loop:**
    *   Handle user input.
    *   Update the snake's position.
    *   Check for food consumption.
    *   Check for collisions.
    *   Update the score.
    *   Render the game state.
3.  **Collision Handling:** If a collision occurs, end the game.
4.  **Scorekeeping:** Update the score when the snake eats food.
5.  **Game Over Handling:** Display a "Game Over" message and offer to restart the game.

**IV. `render.py` - Rendering**

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize the rendering engine (e.g., Pygame, Tkinter).
2.  **Drawing Functions:** Implement functions to draw the snake, food, and score on the screen.
3.  **Screen Updates:** Implement a function to update the screen with the latest game state.

**V. `input_handler.py` - Input Handling**

1.  **Event Handling:** Implement a function to handle user input events (e.g., key presses).
2.  **Direction Mapping:** Map key presses to snake movement directions.

**VI. `config.py` - Configuration (Optional)**

1.  **Game Parameters:** Define game parameters such as screen size, snake speed, colors, and boundary limits.

This detailed plan outlines the steps for implementing each file. I'll prioritize implementing the core logic in `snake.py`, `food.py`, and `game.py` first, then move on to rendering and input handling. The `config.py` file can be added later to make the game more configurable.
