# Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

2025-12-04 16:19:45,136 - HyperAgent.LoggingIOConsole - INFO: Here is a high-level outline of how you can create a snake game in Python:

1. Set up the game board: Create a grid-based game board using a two-dimensional array or list. Define the dimensions of the grid, such as 10x10. Display the grid on the screen using ASCII characters or graphics.
2. Initialize the snake: Place the snake on the game board at a random position. Define the initial length and starting position of the snake. Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input.
3. Implement arrow key controls for snake movement: Use keyboard inputs (e.g., up, down, left, right) to move the snake in the chosen direction. Update the snake's position on the grid based on its direction and length.
4. Generate food at random positions: Generate food at random positions on the game board. Ensure that food does not appear on the snake's body.
5. Detect collisions: Use a collision detection algorithm to detect collisions between the snake and the boundaries, its own body, or the food. When a collision occurs, trigger a game over scenario.
6. Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food: Increase the length of the snake by adding a new segment to its body when it consumes food.
7. Display the score: Implement a scoring system that displays the current score on the screen.
8. Trigger game over scenarios: When the snake collides with the boundaries or itself, trigger a game over scenario and display a message. Allow the player to restart the game by clearing the current game state and reinitializing the snake.
9. Implement graphics and user interface: Use ASCII characters or graphics to represent the snake and food. Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions for playing the game.
10. Add animations and effects: Add animations for snake movement and growth, as well as visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

This is just a high-level outline of how you can create a snake game in Python. You will need to implement more details and considerations, such as handling keyboard inputs, updating the game state, and rendering the game board and snake on the screen.
