# Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

Action: the action as block of code to take 
Observation: the result of the action
... (this process can repeat multiple times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

For example:

Query: Please find the file and function definition for the `separability_matrix` function in the astropy codebase.

Thought: To find the definition of the `separability_matrix` function, I will first search for it in the codebase using the `code_search` tool.

Action:
```python
result = code_search._run(names=["separability_matrix"])
print(result)
```

Observation:
Results for separability_matrix:
====================
File: astropy/modeling/separable.py
Name: separability_matrix
Line Range: (65, 101)
Documentation: 
    Compute the correlation between outputs and inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transform : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model`
        A (compound) model.

    Returns
    -------
    separable_matrix : ndarray
        A boolean correlation matrix of shape (n_outputs, n_inputs).
        Indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs. For completely
        independent outputs, the diagonal elements are True and
        off-diagonal elements are False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Shift, Scale, Rotation2D, Polynomial2D
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Scale(1) & Scale(2))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Rotation2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]) |         Polynomial2D(1) & Polynomial2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True], [ True, False], [False,  True]]...)

Thought:
The `separability_matrix` function is defined in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module. It takes a `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` object as input and returns a boolean correlation matrix indicating the dependence of the model's outputs on its inputs.
The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. To understand this better, I will:

1. Look at the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function.
2. Check if there are any known issues or discussions related to this in the Astropy codebase.

Action:
```python
result = open_file._run(relative_file_path="astropy/modeling/separable.py", keywords=["separability_matrix"], start_line=65, end_line=101)
print(result)
```

### Steps Taken:

1. **Explore Folder Structure**:
   - Initially attempted to explore the folder structure but only found `.git` directory contents.

2. **Keyword Searches**:
   - Searched for keywords like "Snake", "game", "grid", "snake_game", and "movement" using `code_search`.
   - No direct references or relevant files were found in these searches.

### Conclusion:
- There are no existing implementations of a Snake game or related components (like grid management, snake movement logic, collision detection, scoring system) in the current codebase.
- No dependencies or frameworks like Pygame were identified through keyword searches.

### Next Steps:
- Since there is no pre-existing implementation, we will need to start from scratch for developing the Snake game.
- Break down the task into smaller parts and assign them to different interns.exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)

I'll break down the task into smaller parts and assign them to different interns for a structured development process.

The first step is to create a basic structure for our game, including grid management and snake initialization. Since this involves creating new files and initial setup, I will delegate this task to the Codebase Editor.

**Intern Name**: Codebase Editor
**Subgoal**:
- Create a new file named `snake_game.py`.
- Set up the basic structure of the Snake game with:
  - Grid management.
  - Snake initialization (define length, starting position).
  - A simple main function to start the game loop.

This will set the foundation for further developments like snake movement, food generation, collision handling, scoring system, and user interface.

    transform : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model`
        A (compound) model.

    Returns
    -------
    separable_matrix : ndarray
        A boolean correlation matrix of shape (n_outputs, n_inputs).
        Indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs. For completely
        independent outputs, the diagonal elements are True and
        off-diagonal elements are False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Shift, Scale, Rotation2D, Polynomial2D
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Scale(1) & Scale(2))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Rotation2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]) |         Polynomial2D(1) & Polynomial2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True], [ True, False], [False,  True]]...)

Thought:
The `separability_matrix` function is defined in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module. It takes a `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` object as input and returns a boolean correlation matrix indicating the dependence of the model's outputs on its inputs.
The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. To understand this better, I will:

1. Look at the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function.
2. Check if there are any known issues or discussions related to this in the Astropy codebase.

Action:
```python
result = open_file._run(relative_file_path="astropy/modeling/separable.py", keywords=["separability_matrix"], start_line=65, end_line=101)
print(result)
```

Begin!
Query: Thought: Since there is no existing implementation of a Snake game or relevant components in the codebase, we need to start from scratch. I'll break down the task into smaller parts and assign them to different interns for a structured development process.

The first step is to create a basic structure for our game, including grid management and snake initialization. Since this involves creating new files and initial setup, I will delegate this task to the Codebase Editor.

**Intern Name**: Codebase Editor
**Subgoal**:
- Create a new file named `snake_game.py`.
- Set up the basic structure of the Snake game with:
  - Grid management.
  - Snake initialization (define length, starting position).
  - A simple main function to start the game loop.

This will set the foundation for further developments like snake movement, food generation, collision handling, scoring system, and user interface.

Action: the action as block of code to take 
Observation: the result of the action
... (this process can repeat multiple times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

For example:

Query: Please find the file and function definition for the `separability_matrix` function in the astropy codebase.

Thought: To find the definition of the `separability_matrix` function, I will first search for it in the codebase using the `code_search` tool.

Action:
```python
result = code_search._run(names=["separability_matrix"])
print(result)
```

Observation:
Results for separability_matrix:
====================
File: astropy/modeling/separable.py
Name: separability_matrix
Line Range: (65, 101)
Documentation: 
    Compute the correlation between outputs and inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transform : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model`
        A (compound) model.

    Returns
    -------
    separable_matrix : ndarray
        A boolean correlation matrix of shape (n_outputs, n_inputs).
        Indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs. For completely
        independent outputs, the diagonal elements are True and
        off-diagonal elements are False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Shift, Scale, Rotation2D, Polynomial2D
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Scale(1) & Scale(2))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Rotation2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]) |         Polynomial2D(1) & Polynomial2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True], [ True, False], [False,  True]]...)

Thought:
The `separability_matrix` function is defined in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module. It takes a `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` object as input and returns a boolean correlation matrix indicating the dependence of the model's outputs on its inputs.
The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. To understand this better, I will:

1. Look at the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function.
2. Check if there are any known issues or discussions related to this in the Astropy codebase.

Action:
```python
result = open_file._run(relative_file_path="astropy/modeling/separable.py", keywords=["separability_matrix"], start_line=65, end_line=101)
print(result)
```

2025-12-15 12:41:58,326 - HyperAgent.LoggingIOConsole - INFO: Thought: Since there is no existing implementation of a Snake game or relevant components in the codebase, we need to start from scratch. I'll break down the task into smaller parts and assign them to different interns for a structured development process.

The first step is to create a basic structure for our game, including grid management and snake initialization. Since this involves creating new files and initial setup, I will delegate this task to the Codebase Editor.

This will set the foundation for further developments like snake movement, food generation, collision handling, scoring system, and user interface.

Let me try providing a more specific instruction with an example of what needs to be done in the `snake_game.py` file.

**Intern Name**: Codebase Editor
**Subgoal**:
- Create a new file named `snake_game.py`.
- Add the following basic structure to the file:
  ```python
  import random

  class SnakeGame:
      def __init__(self, width=10, height=10):
          self.width = width
          self.height = height
          self.grid = [[' ' for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
          self.snake = [(height // 2, width // 2)]
          self.direction = (0, 1)  # Starting direction: right

      def display_grid(self):
          for row in self.grid:
              print(' '.join(row))
          print()

      def main_loop(self):
          while True:
              # Game loop logic here
              pass

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      game = SnakeGame()
      game.display_grid()
      game.main_loop()
  ```

This example sets up the basic grid, initializes the snake, and includes a placeholder for the main game loop.

Results for separability_matrix:
====================
File: astropy/modeling/separable.py
Name: separability_matrix
Line Range: (65, 101)
Documentation: 
    Compute the correlation between outputs and inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transform : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model`
        A (compound) model.

    Returns
    -------
    separable_matrix : ndarray
        A boolean correlation matrix of shape (n_outputs, n_inputs).
        Indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs. For completely
        independent outputs, the diagonal elements are True and
        off-diagonal elements are False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Shift, Scale, Rotation2D, Polynomial2D
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Scale(1) & Scale(2))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Rotation2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]) |         Polynomial2D(1) & Polynomial2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True], [ True, False], [False,  True]]...)

Thought:
The `separability_matrix` function is defined in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module. It takes a `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` object as input and returns a boolean correlation matrix indicating the dependence of the model's outputs on its inputs.
The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. To understand this better, I will:

1. Look at the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function.
2. Check if there are any known issues or discussions related to this in the Astropy codebase.

Action:
```python
result = open_file._run(relative_file_path="astropy/modeling/separable.py", keywords=["separability_matrix"], start_line=65, end_line=101)
print(result)
```

Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

For example:

Query: Please find the file and function definition for the `separability_matrix` function in the astropy codebase.

Thought: To find the definition of the `separability_matrix` function, I will first search for it in the codebase using the `code_search` tool.

Action:
```python
result = code_search._run(names=["separability_matrix"])
print(result)
```

Observation:
Results for separability_matrix:
====================
File: astropy/modeling/separable.py
Name: separability_matrix
Line Range: (65, 101)
Documentation: 
    Compute the correlation between outputs and inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transform : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model`
        A (compound) model.

    Returns
    -------
    separable_matrix : ndarray
        A boolean correlation matrix of shape (n_outputs, n_inputs).
        Indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs. For completely
        independent outputs, the diagonal elements are True and
        off-diagonal elements are False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Shift, Scale, Rotation2D, Polynomial2D
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Scale(1) & Scale(2))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Rotation2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]) |         Polynomial2D(1) & Polynomial2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True], [ True, False], [False,  True]]...)

Thought:
The `separability_matrix` function is defined in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module. It takes a `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` object as input and returns a boolean correlation matrix indicating the dependence of the model's outputs on its inputs.
The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. To understand this better, I will:

1. Look at the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function.
2. Check if there are any known issues or discussions related to this in the Astropy codebase.

Action:
```python
result = open_file._run(relative_file_path="astropy/modeling/separable.py", keywords=["separability_matrix"], start_line=65, end_line=101)
print(result)
```

1. **Food Generation**: Add a method to randomly place food on the grid.
2. **Collision Detection**:

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action as block of code to take 
Observation: the result of the action
... (this process can repeat multiple times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

For example:

Query: Please find the file and function definition for the `separability_matrix` function in the astropy codebase.

Thought: To find the definition of the `separability_matrix` function, I will first search for it in the codebase using the `code_search` tool.

Action:
```python
result = code_search._run(names=["separability_matrix"])
print(result)
```

Observation:
Results for separability_matrix:
====================
File: astropy/modeling/separable.py
Name: separability_matrix
Line Range: (65, 101)
Documentation: 
    Compute the correlation between outputs and inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transform : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model`
        A (compound) model.

    Returns
    -------
    separable_matrix : ndarray
        A boolean correlation matrix of shape (n_outputs, n_inputs).
        Indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs. For completely
        independent outputs, the diagonal elements are True and
        off-diagonal elements are False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Shift, Scale, Rotation2D, Polynomial2D
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Scale(1) & Scale(2))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Rotation2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]) |         Polynomial2D(1) & Polynomial2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True], [ True, False], [False,  True]]...)

Thought:
The `separability_matrix` function is defined in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module. It takes a `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` object as input and returns a boolean correlation matrix indicating the dependence of the model's outputs on its inputs.
The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. To understand this better, I will:

1. Look at the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function.
2. Check if there are any known issues or discussions related to this in the Astropy codebase.

Action:
```python
result = open_file._run(relative_file_path="astropy/modeling/separable.py", keywords=["separability_matrix"], start_line=65, end_line=101)
print(result)
```

Begin!

                self.set_direction('UP')
            elif key == 's':
                self.set_direction('DOWN')
            elif key == 'a':
                self.set_direction('LEFT')
            elif key == 'd':
                self.set_direction('RIGHT')

            self.move_snake()
            self.display_grid()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = SnakeGame()
    game.display_grid()
    game.main_loop()
```

With this implementation, the snake will move using arrow keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`), consume food to grow longer, and the game ends on collision with boundaries or self.

Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action as block of code to take 
Observation: the result of the action
... (this process can repeat multiple times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

For example:

Query: Please find the file and function definition for the `separability_matrix` function in the astropy codebase.

Thought: To find the definition of the `separability_matrix` function, I will first search for it in the codebase using the `code_search` tool.

Action:
```python
result = code_search._run(names=["separability_matrix"])
print(result)
```

Observation:
Results for separability_matrix:
====================
File: astropy/modeling/separable.py
Name: separability_matrix
Line Range: (65, 101)
Documentation: 
    Compute the correlation between outputs and inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transform : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model`
        A (compound) model.

    Returns
    -------
    separable_matrix : ndarray
        A boolean correlation matrix of shape (n_outputs, n_inputs).
        Indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs. For completely
        independent outputs, the diagonal elements are True and
        off-diagonal elements are False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Shift, Scale, Rotation2D, Polynomial2D
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Scale(1) & Scale(2))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Rotation2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]) |         Polynomial2D(1) & Polynomial2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True], [ True, False], [False,  True]]...)

Thought:
The `separability_matrix` function is defined in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module. It takes a `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` object as input and returns a boolean correlation matrix indicating the dependence of the model's outputs on its inputs.
The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. To understand this better, I will:

1. Look at the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function.
2. Check if there are any known issues or discussions related to this in the Astropy codebase.

Action:
```python
result = open_file._run(relative_file_path="astropy/modeling/separable.py", keywords=["separability_matrix"], start_line=65, end_line=101)
print(result)
```

Begin!
Query: Thought: Since the directory is now created, I'll provide the full code for `snake_game.py`, which includes the snake movement logic as well as food generation and collision detection. This will allow us to test the game functionality comprehensively.
