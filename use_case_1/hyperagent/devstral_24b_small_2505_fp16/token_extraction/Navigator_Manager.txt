Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action as block of code to take
Observation: the result of the action
... (this process can repeat multiple times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

For example:

Query: Please find the file and function definition for the `separability_matrix` function in the astropy codebase.

Thought: To find the definition of the `separability_matrix` function, I will first search for it in the codebase using the `code_search` tool.

Action:
```python
result = code_search._run(names=["separability_matrix"])
print(result)
```

Results for separability_matrix:
====================
File: astropy/modeling/separable.py
Name: separability_matrix
Line Range: (65, 101)
Documentation:
    Compute the correlation between outputs and inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    transform : `~astropy.modeling.core.Model`
        A (compound) model.

    Returns
    -------
    separable_matrix : ndarray
        A boolean correlation matrix of shape (n_outputs, n_inputs).
        Indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs. For completely
        independent outputs, the diagonal elements are True and
        off-diagonal elements are False.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from astropy.modeling.models import Shift, Scale, Rotation2D, Polynomial2D
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Scale(1) & Scale(2))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Rotation2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]) |         Polynomial2D(1) & Polynomial2D(2))
        array([[ True,  True], [ True,  True]]...)
    >>> separability_matrix(Shift(1) & Shift(2) | Mapping([0, 1, 0, 1]))
        array([[ True, False], [False,  True], [ True, False], [False,  True]]...)

Thought:
The `separability_matrix` function is defined in the `astropy.modeling.separable` module. It takes a `~astropy.modeling.core.Model` object as input and returns a boolean correlation matrix indicating the dependence of the model's outputs on its inputs.
The issue appears to be related to the behavior of the `separability_matrix` function when dealing with nested compound models. To understand this better, I will:

1. Look at the implementation of the `separability_matrix` function.
2. Check if there are any known issues or discussions related to this in the Astropy codebase.

Action:
```python
result = open_file._run(relative_file_path="astropy/modeling/separable.py", keywords=["separability_matrix"], start_line=65, end_line=101)
print(result)
```

Query: Thought: The task is to create a simple Snake game in Python, adhering to several requirements like grid-based game board, snake initialization, movement control via arrow keys, collision handling, score display, and game over conditions with restart functionality. I'll need to break down this task into smaller manageable parts and delegate them among the interns.

**Intern Name**: Codebase Navigator
**Subgoal**:
- Check if there's already an implementation of a Snake game or relevant components like grid management, snake movement logic, collision detection, and scoring system in our codebase.
- Provide a list of existing files related to Snake game development and any dependencies or frameworks used (like Pygame).

To start, I need to explore the folder structure of the repository to understand its organization and identify potential locations for relevant code. Then, I will search for specific keywords like "snake", "grid", "game", etc., that might indicate existing implementations related to a Snake game or components like grid management, snake movement logic, collision detection, and scoring systems.

Action:
```python
result = get_folder_structure._run(relative_path=".", depth=2)
print(result)
```

### Steps Taken:

1. **Explore Folder Structure**:
   - Initially attempted to explore the folder structure but only found `.git` directory contents.

2. **Keyword Searches**:
   - Searched for keywords like "Snake", "game", "grid", "snake_game", and "movement" using `code_search`.
   - No direct references or relevant files were found in these searches.

### Conclusion:
- There are no existing implementations of a Snake game or related components (like grid management, snake movement logic, collision detection, scoring system) in the current codebase.
- No dependencies or frameworks like Pygame were identified through keyword searches.

### Next Steps:
- Since there is no pre-existing implementation, we will need to start from scratch for developing the Snake game.
- Break down the task into smaller parts and assign them to different interns.exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)
