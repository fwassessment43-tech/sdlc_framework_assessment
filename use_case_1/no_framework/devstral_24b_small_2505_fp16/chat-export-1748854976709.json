Ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n2. Save the script to a file (e.g., snake_game.py).\n3. Run it in a terminal window using: `python snake_game.py`.\n\nThis basic implementation can be further enhanced with better graphics, animations, and more advanced features as desired.","model":"work.devstral:24b-small-2505-fp16","modelName":"devstral:24b-small-2505-fp16","modelIdx":0,"userContext":null,"timestamp":1748854520,"lastSentence":"3.
