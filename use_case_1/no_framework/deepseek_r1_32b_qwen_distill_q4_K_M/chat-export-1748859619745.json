Grid-based game board (10x10)\n2. Snake initialization with starting position and length\n3. Arrow key controls for movement\n4. Food generation at random positions\n5. Collision detection:\n   - Walls\n   - Self-collision\n   - Food consumption\n6. Score tracking\n7. Game over condition and restart functionality\n8. Simple ASCII graphics\n\nTo play the game:\n\n1. Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction\n2. Collect food ('F') to grow and increase your score\n3. Avoid hitting walls or yourself\n4. Press Space to restart after game over\n5. Press Esc to exit\n\nThe snake is represented by 'O' (head) and '#' (body), while empty spaces are shown as '.'.\n\nNote: This code uses the `msvcrt` module for Windows-based systems.

The main loop will handle user inputs, update the game state, and redraw the board each frame.\n> \n> I need to make sure that after the snake eats food, the next movement doesn't immediately cause a collision by checking before adding the new segment. Also, handling the restart properly by resetting all variables to their initial states is important.\n> \n> Testing each part as I go will help catch any bugs early. For example, ensuring that the snake moves correctly when changing directions and that food doesn't spawn on the snake's body.\n> \n> Finally, I'll make sure the game loop runs smoothly, with appropriate delays between frames so it's not too fast or slow.\n</details>\nHere’s a Python implementation of the Snake game:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport time\nimport msvcrt  # For Windows-based systems\n\n# Game constants\nBOARD_WIDTH = 10\nBOARD_HEIGHT = 10\nSNAKE_INITIAL_LENGTH = 3\nDELAY = 0.15  # Lower value for faster speed\n\ndef main():\n    # Initialize game variables\n    snake = [(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3)]  # Snake starts in the middle\n    food = None\n    direction = 'right'\n    score = 0\n    game_over = False\n\n    def generate_food():\n        nonlocal food\n        while True:\n            food = (random.randint(0, BOARD_HEIGHT-1), random.randint(0, BOARD_WIDTH-1))\n            if food not in snake:\n                break\n\n    def draw_board():\n        # Clear the screen\n        print('\\n' * 50)\n        \n        # Draw score\n        print(f\"Score: {score}\")\n        print(\"Press Space to restart | Esc to exit\")\n        print(\"-\" * (BOARD_WIDTH * 2 + 1))\n        \n        # Create a board filled with empty spaces\n        board = [[' ' for _ in range(BOARD_WIDTH)] for _ in range(BOARD_HEIGHT)]\n        \n        # Draw snake\n        for i, segment in enumerate(snake):\n            y, x = segment\n            if i == 0:\n                board[y][x] = 'O'  # Head of the snake\n            else:\n                board[y][x] = '#'  # Body of the snake\n        \n        # Draw food\n        if food is not None:\n            y, x = food\n            board[y][x] = 'F'\n        \n        # Print the board\n        for row in board:\n            print('|' + '|'.join(row) + '|')\n        print(\"-\" * (BOARD_WIDTH * 2 + 1))\n\n    def change_direction(new_direction):\n        nonlocal direction\n        if new_direction == 'up' and direction != 'down':\n            direction = 'up'\n        elif new_direction == 'down' and direction != 'up':\n            direction = 'down'\n        elif new_direction == 'left' and direction != 'right':\n            direction = 'left'\n        elif new_direction == 'right' and direction != 'left':\n            direction = 'right'\n\n    # Main game loop\n    while True:\n        if not game_over:\n            draw_board()\n            \n            # Generate initial food\n            if food is None:\n                generate_food()\n            \n            # Move snake\n            head_y, head_x = snake[0]\n            dy, dx = 0, 0\n            \n            if direction == 'up':\n                dy = -1\n            elif direction == 'down':\n                dy = 1\n            elif direction == 'left':\n                dx = -1\n            elif direction == 'right':\n                dx = 1\n                \n            new_head = (head_y + dy, head_x + dx)\n            \n            # Check for collisions with walls\n            if new_head[0] < 0 or new_head[0] >= BOARD_HEIGHT or new_head[1] < 0 or new_head[1] >= BOARD_WIDTH:\n                game_over = True\n            \n            # Check for collisions with self\n            if new_head in snake:\n                game_over = True\n            \n            # Update snake position\n            snake.insert(0, new_head)\n            \n            # Check if food is eaten\n            if new_head == food:\n                score += 1\n                generate_food()\n            else:\n                snake.pop()  # Remove tail to maintain length\n            \n            time.sleep(DELAY)\n        \n        else:\n            # Game Over screen\n            print(\"\\nGame Over!\")\n            print(f\"Final Score: {score}\")\n            print(\"Press Space to restart | Esc to exit\")\n            \n            # Wait for input\n            while True:\n                if msvcrt.kbhit():\n                    key = ord(msvcrt.getch())\n                    if key == 32:  # Space key\n                        snake = [(5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3)]\n                        direction = 'right'\n                        score = 0\n                        game_over = False\n                        break\n                    elif key == 27:  # Esc key\n                        return\n        \n        # Handle keyboard input for movement\n        if msvcrt.kbhit():\n            key = ord(msvcrt.getch())\n            if key == 72:  # Up arrow\n                change_direction('up')\n            elif key == 80:  # Down arrow\n                change_direction('down')\n            elif key == 75:  # Left arrow\n                change_direction('left')\n            elif key == 77:  # Right arrow\n                change_direction('right')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis implementation includes all the required features:\n\n1. Grid-based game board (10x10)\n2. Snake initialization with starting position and length\n3. Arrow key controls for movement\n4. Food generation at random positions\n5. Collision detection:\n   - Walls\n   - Self-collision\n   - Food consumption\n6. Score tracking\n7. Game over condition and restart functionality\n8. Simple ASCII graphics\n\nTo play the game:\n\n1. Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction\n2. Collect food ('F') to grow and increase your score\n3. Avoid hitting walls or yourself\n4. Press Space to restart after game over\n5. Press Esc to exit\n\nThe snake is represented by 'O' (head) and '#' (body), while empty spaces are shown as '.'.\n\nNote: This code uses the `msvcrt` module for Windows-based systems.
