Import necessary libraries: You will need to import libraries such as Pygame or Tkinter for creating the game board and handling user input.\n2. Create a game board: Define the dimensions of the grid-based game board and create a list or array to represent the cells on the board.\n3. Initialize the snake: Place the snake on the game board, defining its initial length and starting position. Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input.\n4. Handle arrow key inputs: Implement code to detect when the player presses an arrow key, and update the snake's direction accordingly.\n5. Update snake position: Continuously update the snake's position on the game board based on its current direction.\n6. Generate food: Randomly generate positions for food on the game board to prevent it from appearing in the same location as the snake.\n7. Handle collisions: Detect when the snake collides with the game board boundaries or its own body, and trigger a game over scenario.\n8. Increase snake length: When the snake consumes food, increase its length by adding a new segment to its body.\n9. Display score: Implement a scoring system to track the player's progress and display the current score on the screen.\n10. Animate snake movement: Add animations for snake movement and growth.\n11. Implement game over scenario: When the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body, display a game over message and allow the player to restart the game.\n12. Design user-friendly interface: Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food, and design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.\n13.
