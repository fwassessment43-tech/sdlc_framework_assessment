## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

For example, the `handle_events` method is not handling the case where a move is not successful (e.g., if the player tries to move into a wall). Additionally, the `play` method is not checking for game over conditions and is not returning any information about the outcome of the game.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n\t* The code appears to have some minor issues with the logic, as mentioned in the previous question. However, it does not appear to have any major errors that would prevent it from functioning correctly.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n\t* Yes, the code follows the data structures and interfaces provided in the requirements.\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n\t* No, the `handle_events` method is not fully implemented as per the requirements. It needs to handle the case where a move is not successful (e.g., if the player tries to move into a wall) and return the updated game state. Additionally, the `play` method should check for game over conditions and return information about the outcome of the game.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n\t* Yes, all necessary dependencies have been imported as per the requirements.\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n\t* Yes, the `handle_events` method is being used correctly by calling it in the `play` method. Additionally, the `game.py` file is being imported correctly and its functions are being called correctly.\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements.\n2. Yes, the logic of the code is completely correct.\n3. No, the existing code does not follow the "Data structures and interfaces" provided. The `Game` class has a hard-coded difficulty level of 1, which should be passed in as an argument to the constructor. Additionally, the `play` method does not return anything, but it should return the score of the game.\n4. No, function B is not implemented. It should be added to the `Game` class to handle the game logic.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.\n6. No, methods from other files are not being reused correctly. The `handle_events` method in `main.py` updates the game state only if a move is successful, but it does not check for any other conditions that may affect the game state. It should be updated to handle all possible conditions and update the game state accordingly.\n\n## Actions:\n1. Implement the `Game` class with a constructor that takes in a difficulty level as an argument.\n2. Add the `play` method to the `Game` class that returns the score of the game based on the difficulty level.\n3. Update the `handle_events` method in `main.py` to handle all possible conditions and update the game state accordingly.\n4. Implement function B in the `Game` class to handle the game logic.\n\n## Code Review Result: LBTM\nThe code does not follow the "Data structures and interfaces" provided, and there are some errors in the logic of the code. However, it is still possible to implement the functionality using the given code. Therefore, I recommend fixing these issues and then reviewing the code again.\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite main.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## main.py\n...\n```\n'}]
