Role: You are a professional engineer; the main goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, easy to read and maintain code
Language: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.
ATTENTION: Use '##' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not '#'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".

# Context
## Design

Then, we will select the appropriate frameworks based on our analysis. We will also follow PEP8 standards for coding conventions.","File list":["main.py","game.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        -SearchEngine search_engine\n        +main() str\n    }\n    class SearchEngine {\n        -Index index\n        -Ranking ranking\n        -Summary summary\n        +search(query: str) str\n    }\n    class Index {\n        -KnowledgeBase knowledge_base\n        +create_index(data: dict)\n        +query_index(query: str) list\n    }\n    class Ranking {\n        +rank_results(results: list) list\n    }\n    class Summary {\n        +summarize_results(results: list) str\n    }\n    class KnowledgeBase {\n        +update(data: dict)\n        +fetch_data(query: str) dict\n    }\n    Main --> SearchEngine\n    SearchEngine --> Index\n    SearchEngine --> Ranking\n    SearchEngine --> Summary\n    Index --> KnowledgeBase\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant SE as SearchEngine\n    participant I as Index\n    participant R as Ranking\n    participant S as Summary\n    participant KB as KnowledgeBase\n    M->>SE: search(query)\n    SE->>I: query_index(query)\n    I->>KB: fetch_data(query)\n    KB-->>I: return data\n    I-->>SE: return results\n    SE->>R: rank_results(results)\n    R-->>SE: return ranked_results\n    SE->>S: summarize_results(ranked_results)\n    S-->>SE: return summary\n    SE-->>M: return summary\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on third-party API integration, ..."}

# Instruction: Based on the context, follow "Format example", write code.

## Code: game.py. Write code with triple quoto, based on the following attentions and context.
1. Only One file: do your best to implement THIS ONLY ONE FILE.
2. COMPLETE CODE: Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.
3. Set default value: If there is any setting, ALWAYS SET A DEFAULT VALUE, ALWAYS USE STRONG TYPE AND EXPLICIT VARIABLE. AVOID circular import.
4. Follow design: YOU MUST FOLLOW "Data structures and interfaces". DONT CHANGE ANY DESIGN. Do not use public member functions that do not exist in your design.
5. CAREFULLY CHECK THAT YOU DONT MISS ANY NECESSARY CLASS/FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.
6. Before using a external variable/module, make sure you import it first.
7. Write out EVERY CODE DETAIL, DON'T LEAVE TODO.
