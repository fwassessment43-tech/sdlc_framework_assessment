The game is a console application using the curses library; no external GUI frameworks are required. Each component is isolated to aid testing and future extension (e.g., adding levels or AI).","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specification mentions optional animations for movement and growth but does not detail the desired effect. In a console environment, a simple flash or brief delay can simulate animation. If a richer graphical animation is required, a different rendering backend (e.g., Pygame) would be necessary. Clarify whether the simple console animation suffices or a graphical window is expected."}
