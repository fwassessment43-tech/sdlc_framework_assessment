### Project Name


### Original Requirements
# Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snakeâs position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesnât appear on the snakeâs body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snakeâs head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snakeâs head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snakeâs body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

### Search Information
