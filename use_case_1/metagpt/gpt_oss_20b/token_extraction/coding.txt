# Context
## Design
{"Implementation approach":"We will build the game as a small, selfâcontained console application using the standard `curses` library for realâtime keyboard input and screen drawing. The core logic will be split into a handful of focused classes:\n\n* **Game** â owns the main loop, coordinates input, update and rendering, and manages the overall state (running, paused, gameâover).\n* **Snake** â stores the ordered list of grid coordinates that make up the snake, handles movement, growth and collision checks.\n* **Food** â keeps the current food position and can generate a new one that never overlaps the snake.\n* **Grid** â represents the 10Ã10 board, provides bounds checking and a helper to convert coordinates to screen positions.\n* **Renderer** â draws the grid, snake, food and UI elements (score, gameâover message) onto the curses window.\n* **InputHandler** â translates arrowâkey events into direction changes while preventing 180Â° reversals.\n\nThe game loop will run at a fixed tick rate (e.g. 10 frames per second). Each tick we:\n1. Poll for a key press.\n2. Update the snakeâs direction.\n3. Move the snake forward.\n4. Check for collisions (wall, self, food).\n5. Grow the snake and update the score if food is eaten.\n6. Render the updated state.\n\nThis separation keeps the code testable, readable and easily extensible (e.g. adding levels or AI). All state is kept in plain Python data structures (lists, tuples, ints) so no external dependencies are required beyond the standard library.\n\n","File list":["main.py","game.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Game {\n        -grid: Grid\n        -snake: Snake\n        -food: Food\n        -renderer: Renderer\n        -input_handler: InputHandler\n        -score: int\n        -running: bool\n        +__init__(window: curses.window)\n        +start() void\n        +handle_input() void\n        +update() void\n        +render() void\n        +game_over() void\n    }\n    class Snake {\n        -body: List[Tuple[int,int]]\n        -direction: Tuple[int,int]\n        +__init__(start_pos: Tuple[int,int], start_dir: Tuple[int,int])\n        +move() void\n        +grow() void\n        +set_direction(new_dir: Tuple[int,int]) void\n        +collides_with_self() bool\n        +collides_with_wall(grid: Grid) bool\n        +head() Tuple[int,int]\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -position: Tuple[int,int]\n        +__init__(grid: Grid, snake: Snake)\n        +generate_new(grid: Grid, snake: Snake) void\n        +position() Tuple[int,int]\n    }\n    class Grid {\n        -width: int\n        -height: int\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int)\n        +in_bounds(pos: Tuple[int,int]) bool\n        +to_screen_coords(pos: Tuple[int,int]) Tuple[int,int]\n    }\n    class Renderer {\n        -window: curses.window\n        +__init__(window: curses.window)\n        +draw(grid: Grid, snake: Snake, food: Food, score: int, game_over: bool) void\n        +clear() void\n    }\n    class InputHandler {\n        -last_direction: Tuple[int,int]\n        +__init__()\n        +get_direction(key: int) Tuple[int,int]\n    }\n    Game --> Snake\n    Game --> Food\n    Game --> Grid\n    Game --> Renderer\n    Game --> InputHandler\n    Snake --> Grid\n    Food --> Grid\n    Renderer --> Grid\n    Renderer --> Snake\n    Renderer --> Food\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant I as InputHandler\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    participant R as Renderer\n    participant Gd as Grid\n\n    M->>G: __init__(curses_window)\n    G->>Gd: __init__(10,10)\n    G->>S: __init__(center, RIGHT)\n    G->>F: __init__(Gd, S)\n    G->>R: __init__(curses_window)\n    G->>I: __init__()\n    G->>G: start()\n\n    loop every tick\n        G->>I: get_direction(key)\n        I->>G: set_direction\n        G->>S: move()\n        G->>S: collides_with_self() -> bool\n        alt collision\n            G->>G: game_over()\n            G->>R: draw(..., game_over=true)\n            G->>G: break loop\n        else\n            G->>F: position()\n            alt ate food\n                G->>S: grow()\n                G->>S: score++\n                G->>F: generate_new(Gd, S)\n            end\n            G->>R: draw(..., game_over=false)\n        end\n    end\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specification mentions \"optional animations for movement and growth\" but does not detail the desired effect. In a console environment, we can simulate a simple animation by briefly flashing the new head position or adding a short delay after growth. If more elaborate animations (e.g., smooth scrolling) are required, a different rendering backend (e.g., Pygame) would be necessary. Clarify whether the simple console animation suffices or if a graphical window is expected."}

# Instruction: Based on the context, follow "Format example", write code.

## Code: main.py. Write code with triple quoto, based on the following attentions and context.
1. Only One file: do your best to implement THIS ONLY ONE FILE.
2. COMPLETE CODE: Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.
3. Set default value: If there is any setting, ALWAYS SET A DEFAULT VALUE, ALWAYS USE STRONG TYPE AND EXPLICIT VARIABLE. AVOID circular import.
4. Follow design: YOU MUST FOLLOW "Data structures and interfaces". DONT CHANGE ANY DESIGN. Do not use public member functions that do not exist in your design.
5. CAREFULLY CHECK THAT YOU DONT MISS ANY NECESSARY CLASS/FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.
6. Before using a external variable/module, make sure you import it first.
7. Write out EVERY CODE DETAIL, DON'T LEAVE TODO.
