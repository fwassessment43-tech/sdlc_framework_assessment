# Format example 1
## Code Review: snake_game.py
1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. No, function B is not implemented, ...
5. ...
6. ...

## Actions
1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```
2. Implement function B

# Format example 1
## Code Review: main.py
1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. No, function B is not implemented, ...
5. ...
6. ...

## Actions
1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```
2. Implement function B

## Code Review: Ordered List. Based on the "Code to be Reviewed", provide key, clear, concise, and specific answer. If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.
1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.
2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.
3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?
4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.
5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported
6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?

## Actions: Ordered List. Things that should be done after CR, such as implementing class A and function B

## Code Review Result: str. If the code doesn't have bugs, we don't need to rewrite it, so answer LGTM and stop. ONLY ANSWER LGTM/LBTM.

## Code Review: main.py
1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...
2. ... because it's not correctly handling snake direction changes.
3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as it uses a SnakeGame instance with Direction enum.
4. No, function B is not implemented, so we need to implement it step by step:
    * Define the `handle_events` method in the Game class to update the game state based on user input.
    * Implement the `move` method in the SnakeGame class to handle snake direction changes.
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies are imported, including pygame and typing.
6. No, methods from other files (snake_game.py) are not being reused correctly as they are not being called from the main file.

## Actions:
1. Implement the `handle_events` method in the Game class to update the game state based on user input.
2. Define the `move` method in the SnakeGame class to handle snake direction changes.
3. Call the `render` method in the UI class after updating the game state.

## Code Review Result: LBTM

# Format example 1
## Code Review: main.py
1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. No, function B is not implemented, ...
5. ...
6. ...

## Actions
1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```

## Code Review: main.py
1. Yes, the code is implemented as per the requirements. The `Game` class initializes a `SnakeGame` instance with a width and height of 800x600 pixels. The `UI` class creates a game screen with the same dimensions.

2. No, there are errors in the logic of the `check_collision` method in the `Game` class. In this line:
```python
if (head_x < 0 or head_x >= self.snake_game.width or
    head_y < 0 or head_y >= self.snake_game.height or
    head_x in [x for x, y in self.snake_game.snake[:-1]]):
```
The condition `head_x in [x for x, y in self.snake_game.snake[:-1]]` is incorrect. It should be checking if the new head position is already occupied by a part of the snake body, not just its x-coordinate.

To fix this, we need to modify the line to:
```python
if (head_x < 0 or head_x >= self.snake_game.width or
    head_y < 0 or head_y >= self.snake_game.height or
    (head_x, head_y) in self.snake_game.snake[:-1]):
```
3. Yes, the existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" as it defines a `SnakeGame` class with attributes for width, height, snake positions, direction, and food position.

4. No, function B is not implemented. The `handle_events` method in the `UI` class should be modified to update the game state only if a move is successful.

To implement this, we need to add a check to see if the move was successful before updating the game state:
```python
def handle_events(self):
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            return False
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            moved = False
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                moved = self.game.move('UP')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
            if moved:
                # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                self.render()
    return True
```
5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.

6. No, methods from other files are not being reused correctly. The `SnakeGame` class has an `update` method that should be called in the `handle_events` method of the `UI` class to update the game state.

To fix this, we need to modify the `handle_events` method to call the `update` method:
```python
def handle_events(self):
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            return False
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            moved = False
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                moved = self.game.move('UP')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
            if moved:
                # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                self.snake_game.update()
                self.render()
    return True
```
## Actions: Ordered List

1. Implement function B to update the game state only if a move is successful.
2. Modify the `handle_events` method to call the `update` method of the `SnakeGame` instance.
