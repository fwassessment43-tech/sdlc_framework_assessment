All coordinates are represented as tuples (x, y). The game loop handles user input, updates the game state, and renders the game board.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The desired difficulty level and initial snake speed are unclear. Should the snake's speed increase over time? Also, the specific visual style (e.g., block size, colors) is not defined. Should we use a fixed block size or allow it to be configurable? The initial starting position of the snake should be clarified. Should it always be in the center, or should it be random?"}
