# Context
## Design
{"Implementation approach":"We will implement the snake game using the Pygame library for handling graphics and user input. Pygame provides a simple and efficient way to create 2D games in Python. The game will be structured into classes representing the snake, food, and game board. The main game loop will handle user input, update game state, and render the game board. Collision detection will be implemented to handle game over conditions. We will use a grid-based approach to represent the game board and snake movement.","File list":["main.py","snake.py","food.py","game_board.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Main {\n        -game_board: GameBoard\n        -snake: Snake\n        -food: Food\n        -running: bool\n        +__init__()\n        +run()\n    }\n    class GameBoard {\n        -width: int\n        -height: int\n        -block_size: int\n        -color: tuple\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int, block_size: int, color: tuple)\n        +draw(screen)\n    }\n    class Snake {\n        -body: list[tuple]\n        -direction: tuple\n        -color: tuple\n        +__init__(start_position: tuple, color: tuple)\n        +move()\n        +grow()\n        +check_collision(width: int, height: int)\n        +draw(screen)\n        +get_head_position() tuple\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -position: tuple\n        -color: tuple\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int, color: tuple)\n        +generate(width: int, height: int)\n        +draw(screen)\n        +get_position() tuple\n    }\n    Main --> GameBoard : uses\n    Main --> Snake : uses\n    Main --> Food : uses\n    GameBoard -- Snake : contains\n    GameBoard -- Food : contains\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant GB as GameBoard\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    M->>GB: __init__(width, height, block_size, color)\n    M->>S: __init__(start_position, color)\n    M->>F: __init__(width, height, color)\n    loop Game Loop\n        M->>S: move()\n        S->>S: check_collision(width, height)\n        alt Collision Detected\n            M->>M: Game Over\n            break\n        end\n        S->>S: get_head_position()\n        S->>F: get_position()\n        alt Snake eats Food\n            S->>S: grow()\n            F->>F: generate(width, height)\n        end\n        M->>GB: draw(screen)\n        S->>GB: draw(screen)\n        F->>GB: draw(screen)\n    end\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The desired difficulty level and initial snake speed are unclear.

# Instruction: Based on the context, follow "Format example", write code.

## Code: game_board.py. Write code with triple quoto, based on the following attentions and context.
1. Only One file: do your best to implement THIS ONLY ONE FILE.
2. COMPLETE CODE: Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.
3. Set default value: If there is any setting, ALWAYS SET A DEFAULT VALUE, ALWAYS USE STRONG TYPE AND EXPLICIT VARIABLE. AVOID circular import.
4. Follow design: YOU MUST FOLLOW "Data structures and interfaces". DONT CHANGE ANY DESIGN. Do not use public member functions that do not exist in your design.
5. CAREFULLY CHECK THAT YOU DONT MISS ANY NECESSARY CLASS/FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.
6. Before using a external variable/module, make sure you import it first.
7. Write out EVERY CODE DETAIL, DON'T LEAVE TODO.
