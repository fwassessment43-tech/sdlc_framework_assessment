### Original Requirements
# Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snakeâs position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesnât appear on the snakeâs body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snakeâs head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snakeâs head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snakeâs body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

### Search Information

    "Requirement Analysis": "The core requirements involve creating a grid-based game, implementing snake movement and growth, generating food, handling collisions, and displaying a score.  The game should be responsive to user input (arrow keys) and provide clear feedback on game events (collisions, food consumption).  A restart mechanism is essential for replayability.  The UI can be simple, using ASCII characters or basic graphics.  Animations and visual effects would enhance the user experience but are not strictly required for a functional game.",

The game board will be represented by a grid of characters (e.g., '#' for walls, 'O' for the snake, 'F' for food, ' ' for empty spaces). The score will be displayed above or below the game board.  A simple message will indicate the game over condition and prompt the user to restart.",
    "Anything UNCLEAR": "The level of graphical complexity is unclear.  Should the game use ASCII characters, a simple graphics library (like Pygame), or something else?  The desired difficulty level is also unclear.  Should the snake's speed be fixed, or should it increase over time?  The specific rules for collision detection (e.g., what happens if the snake's head touches the wall) should be clarified."
