## Original Requirements

Create a snake game in Python

## Product Goals

- Create a playable and engaging snake game.
- Implement clear game mechanics and user feedback.
- Provide a simple and intuitive user interface.

## User Stories

- As a player, I want to be able to control the snake using the arrow keys.
- As a player, I want the game to end when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- As a player, I want to see my score increase as I eat food.
- As a player, I want to be able to restart the game after it ends.
- As a player, I want the snake to grow longer when it eats food.

## Competitive Analysis

- Classic Snake (various online versions): Simple, widely known, often lacks visual polish.
- Snake '97: Retro aesthetic, challenging gameplay, limited features.
- Slither.io: Multiplayer snake game, competitive, requires internet connection.
- Snake VS Block: Addictive gameplay, block-breaking mechanic, mobile-focused.
- Nibblers: Colorful graphics, power-ups, mobile-focused.
- Google's Snake Game: Accessible, simple, and nostalgic.

## Requirement Analysis

The core requirements involve creating a grid-based game, implementing snake movement and growth, generating food, handling collisions, and displaying a score.  The game should be responsive to user input (arrow keys) and provide clear feedback on game events (collisions, food consumption).  A restart mechanism is essential for replayability.  The UI can be simple, using ASCII characters or basic graphics.  Animations and visual effects would enhance the user experience but are not strictly required for a functional game.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement snake movement based on arrow key input.']
- ['P0', 'Implement food generation at random locations.']
- ['P0', "Detect and handle collisions with walls and the snake's body."]
- ['P1', 'Implement a scoring system and display the score.']
- ['P2', 'Add basic animations for snake movement and growth.']

## UI Design draft

The game will be displayed in a terminal window. The game board will be represented by a grid of characters (e.g., '#' for walls, 'O' for the snake, 'F' for food, ' ' for empty spaces). The score will be displayed above or below the game board.  A simple message will indicate the game over condition and prompt the user to restart.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The level of graphical complexity is unclear.  Should the game use ASCII characters, a simple graphics library (like Pygame), or something else?  The desired difficulty level is also unclear.  Should the snake's speed be fixed, or should it increase over time?  The specific rules for collision detection (e.g., what happens if the snake's head touches the wall) should be clarified.
