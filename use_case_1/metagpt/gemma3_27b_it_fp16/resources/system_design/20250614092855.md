## Implementation approach

We will implement the snake game using the Pygame library for handling graphics and user input. Pygame provides a simple and efficient way to create 2D games in Python. The game will be structured into classes representing the snake, food, and game board. The main game loop will handle user input, update game state, and render the game board. Collision detection will be implemented to handle game over conditions. We will use a grid-based approach to represent the game board and snake movement.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The desired difficulty level and initial snake speed are unclear. Should the snake's speed increase over time? Also, the specific visual style (e.g., block size, colors) is not defined. Should we use a fixed block size or allow it to be configurable? The initial starting position of the snake should be clarified. Should it always be in the center, or should it be random?
