## Original Requirements

Create a snake game in Python

## Product Goals

- Create an engaging user experience with smooth snake movement and collision detection
- Improve accessibility by allowing users to restart the game easily and view their current score
- Design a visually appealing UI with clear instructions and responsive graphics

## User Stories

- As a player, I want to be able to control the snake using arrow keys
- As a player, I want to see my current score displayed on the screen
- As a player, I want to be notified when the game is over and have the option to restart
- As a player, I want the game to generate food at random positions on the board without overlapping with the snake's body
- As a player, I want the snake to grow in length when it consumes food

## Competitive Analysis

- Snake Game A: Simple graphics, lacks smooth animation and responsive controls
- Slither.io: Engaging multiplayer experience with beautiful graphics, but limited single-player mode
- Snake Game B: Basic UI, lacks clear instructions and scoring system
- Agar.io: Addictive gameplay with simple yet appealing graphics, but not a traditional snake game
- Google Snake Game: Classic snake game with simple graphics, but limited features and no multiplayer

## Requirement Analysis

The game requires a grid-based board with a snake that can move in four directions (up, down, left, right) using arrow keys. The game should generate food at random positions on the board and increase the snake's length when it consumes the food. Collision detection is necessary to end the game when the snake hits the boundary or its own body. A scoring system and clear instructions are also essential for an engaging user experience.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement a grid-based game board with a defined size (e.g., 10x10)']
- ['P0', 'Create a snake object that can move in four directions using arrow keys']
- ['P1', "Generate food at random positions on the game board without overlapping with the snake's body"]
- ['P1', 'Implement collision detection to end the game when the snake hits the boundary or its own body']
- ['P2', 'Design a visually appealing UI with clear instructions and a scoring system']

## UI Design draft

The game will feature a simple grid-based board with a black background and white grid lines. The snake will be represented by a green line, and the food will be a red dot. The current score will be displayed in the top-left corner of the screen, and clear instructions will be provided at the start of the game.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The project requirements do not specify any particular graphics library or framework for Python. It is assumed that a library like Pygame will be used for creating the game UI and handling user input.
