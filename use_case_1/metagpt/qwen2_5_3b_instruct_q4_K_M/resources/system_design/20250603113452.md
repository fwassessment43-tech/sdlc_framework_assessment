## Implementation approach

We will utilize the Pygame library to create a smooth and engaging snake game. Pygame is an open-source library that provides functions for creating games in Python, including handling graphics, sound, and input. Given the requirements, we need to ensure smooth animations, responsive controls, and a clean UI. The Pygame framework will help us achieve these goals efficiently.

## Data structures and interfaces

        -score: int

    class Snake {
        -body: List[pygame.math.Vector2]
        -direction: pygame.math.Vector2

        -position: pygame.math.Vector2
        -size: int
        +__init__(width: int, height: int) None
        +spawn(position: Optional[pygame.math.Vector2] = None) None

## Program call flow

    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    M->>G: initialize_game(width, height)
    G->>S: __init__(width, height)
    G->>F: __init__(width, height)
    loop Game Loop
        G->>S: move()
        G->>F: spawn()
        G->>S: grow()
        G->>G: update_score(new_score)
        G->>G: draw()
        G->>M: check_collision()
        M-->>G: handle_events()
    end


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the exact behavior of the restart button and how it will be integrated into the game flow.
