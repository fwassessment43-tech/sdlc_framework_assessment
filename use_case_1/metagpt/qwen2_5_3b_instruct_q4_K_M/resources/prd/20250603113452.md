## Original Requirements

Create a snake game in Python

## Product Goals

- Ensure an engaging user experience with smooth animations
- Make the game responsive and easy to navigate
- Implement a clean, intuitive UI

## User Stories

- As a player, I want to control the snake using arrow keys
- As a player, I want to see my score increase as I eat food
- As a player, I want to restart the game when I lose

## Competitive Analysis

- Snake Game A: Simple interface with basic controls and scoring
- Snake Game B: Responsive UI but lacks animations
- Snake Game C: Engaging with smooth animations but complex controls
- Snake Game D: User-friendly with clear instructions, but ads are frequent
- Snake Game E: Beautiful graphics but not very responsive

## Requirement Analysis



## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Create a grid-based game board with dimensions of 10x10']
- ['P0', 'Initialize the snake at the center of the board and set its initial direction to right']
- ['P1', 'Implement arrow key controls for snake movement']
- ['P2', 'Generate food randomly on the board, ensuring it does not overlap with the snake body']
- ['P2', 'Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the game boundaries or its own body']

## UI Design draft

The UI will consist of a 10x10 grid where the snake is represented by ASCII characters. The score will be displayed at the top left corner, and a restart button will appear when the game ends.
