{"Implementation approach":"We will utilize the Pygame library to create a smooth and engaging snake game. Pygame is an open-source library that provides functions for creating games in Python, including handling graphics, sound, and input. Given the requirements, we need to ensure smooth animations, responsive controls, and a clean UI. The Pygame framework will help us achieve these goals efficiently.","File list":["main.py","game.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Game {\n        -screen: pygame.Surface\n        -clock: pygame.time.Clock\n        -snake: Snake\n        -food: Food\n        -score: int\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int) None\n        +run() None\n        +update_score(new_score: int) None\n    }\n    class Snake {\n        -body: List[pygame.math.Vector2]\n        -direction: pygame.math.Vector2\n        -speed: float\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int) None\n        +move() None\n        +grow(body_part: int) None\n        +draw(screen: pygame.Surface) None\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -position: pygame.math.Vector2\n        -size: int\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int) None\n        +spawn(position: Optional[pygame.math.Vector2] = None) None\n        +draw(screen: pygame.Surface) None\n    }\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    M->>G: initialize_game(width, height)\n    G->>S: __init__(width, height)\n    G->>F: __init__(width, height)\n    loop Game Loop\n        G->>S: move()\n        G->>F: spawn()\n        G->>S: grow()\n        G->>G: update_score(new_score)\n        G->>G: draw()\n        G->>M: check_collision()\n        M-->>G: handle_events()\n    end\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the exact behavior of the restart button and how it will be integrated into the game flow."}
