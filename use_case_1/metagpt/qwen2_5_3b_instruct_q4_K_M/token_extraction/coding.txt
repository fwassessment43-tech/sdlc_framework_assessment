Role: You are a professional engineer; the main goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, easy to read and maintain code
Language: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.
ATTENTION: Use '##' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not '#'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".

# Context
## Design
{"Implementation approach":"We will utilize the Pygame library to create a smooth and engaging snake game. Pygame is an open-source library that provides functions for creating games in Python, including handling graphics, sound, and input. Given the requirements, we need to ensure smooth animations, responsive controls, and a clean UI. The Pygame framework will help us achieve these goals efficiently.","File list":["main.py","game.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Game {\n        -screen: pygame.Surface\n        -clock: pygame.time.Clock\n        -snake: Snake\n        -food: Food\n        -score: int\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int) None\n        +run() None\n        +update_score(new_score: int) None\n    }\n    class Snake {\n        -body: List[pygame.math.Vector2]\n        -direction: pygame.math.Vector2\n        -speed: float\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int) None\n        +move() None\n        +grow(body_part: int) None\n        +draw(screen: pygame.Surface) None\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -position: pygame.math.Vector2\n        -size: int\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int) None\n        +spawn(position: Optional[pygame.math.Vector2] = None) None\n        +draw(screen: pygame.Surface) None\n    }\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    M->>G: initialize_game(width, height)\n    G->>S: __init__(width, height)\n    G->>F: __init__(width, height)\n    loop Game Loop\n        G->>S: move()\n        G->>F: spawn()\n        G->>S: grow()\n        G->>G: update_score(new_score)\n        G->>G: draw()\n        G->>M: check_collision()\n        M-->>G: handle_events()\n    end\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the exact behavior of the restart button and how it will be integrated into the game flow."}

## Task
{"Required Python packages":["pygame==2.1.0"],"Required Other language third-party packages":["No third-party dependencies required"],"Logic Analysis":[["game.py","Contains Game class, Snake class, and Food class with their respective methods and initialization"],["main.py","Contains main function that initializes the game and handles events"]],"Task list":["game.py","main.py"],"Full API spec":"","Shared Knowledge":"`game.py` contains functions shared across the project, including Game class, Snake class, and Food class.","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on how the restart button will function and integrate into the game flow."}

# Format example
## Code: game.py
```python
## game.py
...
```

# Instruction: Based on the context, follow "Format example", write code.

## Code: game.py. Write code with triple quoto, based on the following attentions and context.
1. Only One file: do your best to implement THIS ONLY ONE FILE.
2. COMPLETE CODE: Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.
3. Set default value: If there is any setting, ALWAYS SET A DEFAULT VALUE, ALWAYS USE STRONG TYPE AND EXPLICIT VARIABLE. AVOID circular import.
4. Follow design: YOU MUST FOLLOW "Data structures and interfaces". DONT CHANGE ANY DESIGN. Do not use public member functions that do not exist in your design.
5. CAREFULLY CHECK THAT YOU DONT MISS ANY NECESSARY CLASS/FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.
6. Before using a external variable/module, make sure you import it first.
7. Write out EVERY CODE DETAIL, DON'T LEAVE TODO.
