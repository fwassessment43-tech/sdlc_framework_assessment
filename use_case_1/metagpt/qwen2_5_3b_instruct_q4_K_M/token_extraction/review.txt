               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:

               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:

               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True

# Instruction: Based on the actual code situation, follow one of the "Format example". Return only 1 file under review.

## Code Review: Ordered List. Based on the "Code to be Reviewed", provide key, clear, concise, and specific answer. If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.
1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.
2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.
3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?
4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.
5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported
6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?

## Actions: Ordered List. Things that should be done after CR, such as implementing class A and function B

## Code Review Result: str. If the code doesn't have bugs, we don't need to rewrite it, so answer LGTM and stop. ONLY ANSWER LGTM/LBTM.

1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```

# Instruction: Based on the actual code situation, follow one of the "Format example". Return only 1 file under review.

## Code Review: Ordered List. Based on the "Code to be Reviewed", provide key, clear, concise, and specific answer. If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.
1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.
2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.
3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?
4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.
5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported
6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?

## Actions: Ordered List. Things that should be done after CR, such as implementing class A and function B

## Code Review Result: str. If the code doesn't have bugs, we don't need to rewrite it, so answer LGTM and stop. ONLY ANSWER LGTM/LBTM.
