## Original Requirements

Create a snake game in Python

## Product Goals

- Provide an engaging gaming experience with clear instructions.
- Ensure smooth and responsive gameplay on various devices.
- Implement visually appealing graphics to enhance player enjoyment.

## User Stories

- As a player, I want the snake to move automatically so that I can focus on controlling its direction.
- As a player, I want to see my score increase as I eat food and grow longer.
- As a player, I expect clear visual feedback when I collide with boundaries or myself.

## Competitive Analysis

- Snake Game A: Simple interface but lacks smooth animations
- Snake.io: Multiplayer feature but complex UI for beginners
- Classic Snake: No modern graphics and limited customization options
