{"Implementation approach":"We will develop a snake game in Python using Pygame for graphics and user input handling. The focus will be on providing smooth gameplay with clear visual feedback and an engaging experience.","File list":["main.py","game.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Game {\n        -width: int\n        -height: int\n        -snake: Snake\n        -food: Food\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int)\n        +run() None\n        +check_collision() bool\n        +place_food() None\n    }\n    class Snake {\n        -segments: list[tuple[int, int]]\n        -direction: tuple[int, int]\n        +__init__(start_pos: tuple[int, int], start_direction: tuple[int, int])\n        +move(direction: tuple[int, int]) None\n        +grow() None\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -position: tuple[int, int]\n        +__init__() None\n        +randomize_position(snake_segments: list[tuple[int, int]]) None\n    }\n    Game --> Snake\n    Game --> Food\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Main as main.py\n    participant G as Game\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    main.py->>G: __init__(width, height)\n    G->>S: __init__(start_pos, start_direction)\n    G->>F: __init__()\n    loop Gameplay Loop\n        G->>S: move(direction)\n        S-->>G: \n        opt Snake eats food\n            G->>S: grow()\n            S-->>G: \n            G->>F: randomize_position(snake_segments)\n            F-->>G: position\n        end\n        G->>G: check_collision()\n    end\n","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
