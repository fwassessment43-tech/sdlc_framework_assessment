Role: You are a professional engineer; the main goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, easy to read and maintain code
Language: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.
ATTENTION: Use '##' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not '#'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".

# Context
## Design
{"Implementation approach":"We will utilize the Pygame library to create a snake game in Python. The game will feature a grid-based board with clear boundaries, smooth snake movement, and collision detection. We will implement a scoring system that increases when the snake eats food and a restart feature when the snake collides with the boundary or itself.","File list":["main.py","game.py","snake.py","food.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Game {\n        -board: Board\n        -snake: Snake\n        -food: Food\n        +__init__()\n        +run()\n        +handle_events()\n        +update_game_state()\n        +draw_game_elements()\n    }\n    class Board {\n        -width: int\n        -height: int\n        -grid_size: int\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int, grid_size: int)\n        +draw_grid()\n    }\n    class Snake {\n        -body: list\n        -direction: str\n        +__init__()\n        +move()\n        +grow()\n        +check_collision()\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -x: int\n        -y: int\n        +__init__(x: int, y: int)\n        +generate_new_food()\n    }\n    Game --> Board\n    Game --> Snake\n    Game --> Food\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant G as Game\n    participant B as Board\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    G->>B: initialize_board(width, height, grid_size)\n    B-->>G: return board\n    G->>S: initialize_snake()\n    S-->>G: return snake\n    G->>F: generate_food()\n    F-->>G: return food\n    G->>G: run_game_loop()\n    G->>G: handle_events()\n    G->>S: update_snake_position()\n    S-->>G: return new_snake_position\n    G->>F: check_for_food_collision()\n    F-->>G: return food_collision_result\n    G->>G: update_game_state()\n    G->>B: draw_board()\n    B-->>G: return drawn_board\n    G->>S: draw_snake()\n    S-->>G: return drawn_snake\n    G->>F: draw_food()\n    F-->>G: return drawn_food\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the exact grid size and snake movement speed."}

# Instruction: Based on the context, follow "Format example", write code.

## Code: game.py. Write code with triple quoto, based on the following attentions and context.
1. Only One file: do your best to implement THIS ONLY ONE FILE.
2. COMPLETE CODE: Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.
3. Set default value: If there is any setting, ALWAYS SET A DEFAULT VALUE, ALWAYS USE STRONG TYPE AND EXPLICIT VARIABLE. AVOID circular import.
4. Follow design: YOU MUST FOLLOW "Data structures and interfaces". DONT CHANGE ANY DESIGN. Do not use public member functions that do not exist in your design.
5. CAREFULLY CHECK THAT YOU DONT MISS ANY NECESSARY CLASS/FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.
6. Before using a external variable/module, make sure you import it first.
7. Write out EVERY CODE DETAIL, DON'T LEAVE TODO.
