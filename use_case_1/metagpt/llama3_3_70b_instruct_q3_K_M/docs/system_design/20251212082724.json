{"Implementation approach":"We will utilize the Pygame library to create a snake game in Python. The game will feature a grid-based board with clear boundaries, smooth snake movement, and collision detection. We will implement a scoring system that increases when the snake eats food and a restart feature when the snake collides with the boundary or itself.","File list":["main.py","game.py","snake.py","food.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class Game {\n        -board: Board\n        -snake: Snake\n        -food: Food\n        +__init__()\n        +run()\n        +handle_events()\n        +update_game_state()\n        +draw_game_elements()\n    }\n    class Board {\n        -width: int\n        -height: int\n        -grid_size: int\n        +__init__(width: int, height: int, grid_size: int)\n        +draw_grid()\n    }\n    class Snake {\n        -body: list\n        -direction: str\n        +__init__()\n        +move()\n        +grow()\n        +check_collision()\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -x: int\n        -y: int\n        +__init__(x: int, y: int)\n        +generate_new_food()\n    }\n    Game --> Board\n    Game --> Snake\n    Game --> Food\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant G as Game\n    participant B as Board\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    G->>B: initialize_board(width, height, grid_size)\n    B-->>G: return board\n    G->>S: initialize_snake()\n    S-->>G: return snake\n    G->>F: generate_food()\n    F-->>G: return food\n    G->>G: run_game_loop()\n    G->>G: handle_events()\n    G->>S: update_snake_position()\n    S-->>G: return new_snake_position\n    G->>F: check_for_food_collision()\n    F-->>G: return food_collision_result\n    G->>G: update_game_state()\n    G->>B: draw_board()\n    B-->>G: return drawn_board\n    G->>S: draw_snake()\n    S-->>G: return drawn_snake\n    G->>F: draw_food()\n    F-->>G: return drawn_food\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the exact grid size and snake movement speed."}
