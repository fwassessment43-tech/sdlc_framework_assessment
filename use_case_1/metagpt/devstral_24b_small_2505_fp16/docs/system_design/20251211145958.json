{"Implementation approach":"We will implement a simple snake game using Python with Pygame library for graphics and user input handling. The game will feature basic snake movement, food generation, collision detection, score tracking, and a game over screen with restart functionality.","File list":["main.py","snake_game.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class SnakeGame {\n        -screen: Surface\n        -clock: Clock\n        -snake: List[Tuple[int, int]]\n        -direction: str\n        -food: Tuple[int, int]\n        -score: int\n        +__init__(self)\n        +run(self)\n        +handle_events(self)\n        +update(self)\n        +draw(self)\n    }\n    classDiagram\n    class Snake {\n        -body: List[Tuple[int, int]]\n        -direction: str\n        +__init__(self)\n        +move(self)\n        +grow(self)\n        +check_collision(self)\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -position: Tuple[int, int]\n        +__init__(self)\n        +generate_random_position(self)\n    }\n\n    SnakeGame --> Snake\n    SnakeGame --> Food\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant SG as SnakeGame\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    U->>SG: Start game\n    SG->>S: Initialize snake\n    SG->>F: Generate food position\n    loop Game Loop\n        U->>SG: Handle events (key presses)\n        SG->>S: Update direction\n        S->>S: Move snake\n        S-->>SG: Return new head position\n        SG->>S: Check for collision with self or walls\n        alt Snake eats food\n            S->>F: Check if snake head at food position\n            F-->>S: Yes, return True\n            S->>S: Grow snake\n            SG->>F: Generate new food position\n        end\n        SG->>SG: Update score\n        SG->>SG: Draw game elements\n    end\n    alt Game Over\n        U->>SG: Handle events (key presses)\n        SG-->>U: Show game over screen with restart option\n    end\n","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
