{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Create a snake game in Python","Project Name":"snake_game_python","Product Goals":["Create an engaging and interactive user experience for the snake game","Improve the game's performance and responsiveness","Enhance the game's visual appeal with simple yet effective graphics"],"User Stories":["As a player, I want to be able to control the snake using arrow keys","As a player, I want to see my current score displayed on the screen","As a player, I want to be notified when the game is over and have the option to restart","As a player, I want the game to generate food at random positions on the board","As a player, I want the snake to grow longer when it consumes food"],"Competitive Analysis":["Snake Game A: Simple graphics, lacks smooth animations","Slither.io: Engaging multiplayer mode, but limited single-player features","Snake Game B: Basic gameplay, lacks variety in levels or power-ups","Agar.io: Unique gameplay mechanics, but not a traditional snake game","Classic Snake: Timeless gameplay, but outdated graphics and sound effects"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of snake games\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Snake Game A\": [0.2, 0.4]\n    \"Slither.io\": [0.8, 0.9]\n    \"Snake Game B\": [0.1, 0.3]\n    \"Agar.io\": [0.6, 0.7]\n    \"Classic Snake\": [0.4, 0.5]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.8]","Requirement Analysis":"The game requires a grid-based system for the snake to move around in, with the ability to generate food at random positions. The snake should be able to grow longer when it consumes food, and the game should end when the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body. A scoring system should be implemented to track the player's progress.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement a grid-based game board with a size of 10x10"],["P0","Create a snake object that can move around the board using arrow keys"],["P1","Generate food at random positions on the board"],["P1","Implement collision detection for the snake with boundaries and its own body"],["P2","Add a scoring system to track the player's progress"]],"UI Design draft":"The game will feature a simple grid-based layout, with the snake and food represented by basic shapes. The current score will be displayed at the top of the screen, and a game over message will appear when the game ends.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The project requirements do not specify any particular graphics or sound effects, so these aspects will need to be decided upon during development."}
