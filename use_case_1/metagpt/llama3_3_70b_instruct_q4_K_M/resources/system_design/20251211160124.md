## Implementation approach

We will utilize the Pygame library to create a grid-based game board and handle user input. The snake's movement and collision detection will be implemented using basic geometric calculations.

## File list

- main.py
- game.py
- snake.py
- food.py

## Data structures and interfaces

    class Game {
        -board: Board
        -snake: Snake
        -food: Food
        +__init__() None
        +run() None
    }
    class Board {
        -width: int
        -height: int
        +__init__(width: int, height: int) None
        +draw() None
    }
    class Snake {
        -x: int
        -y: int
        -direction: str
        -length: int
        +__init__(x: int, y: int) None
        +move() None
        +grow() None
    }
    class Food {
        -x: int
        -y: int
        +__init__() None
        +generate() None
    }

## Program call flow

    participant M as main.py
    participant G as Game
    participant B as Board
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    M->>G: run()
    G->>B: draw()
    G->>S: move()
    S->>B: check_collision()
    B-->>S: return collision_result
    S->>F: check_food_collision()
    F-->>S: return food_collision_result
    S->>G: update_score()
    G->>M: return game_over_status


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the exact graphics and sound effects to be used in the game, as well as any potential additional features such as level design or power-ups.
