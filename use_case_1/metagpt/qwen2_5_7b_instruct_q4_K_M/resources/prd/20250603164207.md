## Original Requirements

Create a snake game in Python

## Product Goals

- Create an engaging user experience
- Ensure responsiveness and smooth gameplay
- Provide clear instructions and feedback to the player

## User Stories

- As a player, I want to control the snake using arrow keys
- As a player, I want to see my score increase as the game progresses
- As a player, I want to restart the game when I lose without having to quit and start over

## Competitive Analysis

- Snake Game A: Simple controls but lacks visual effects
- Snake Game B: Engaging gameplay with smooth animations
- Snake Game C: Responsive design with clear instructions
- Snake Game D: Complex game mechanics, difficult to learn
- Snake Game E: Minimalistic UI, easy to navigate

## Requirement Analysis



## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Create a grid-based game board with dimensions of 10x10']
- ['P0', 'Initialize the snake at the center of the grid and set its initial length to 3 segments']
- ['P1', 'Implement arrow key controls for snake movement without user input initially']
- ['P2', "Generate food randomly on the game board, ensuring it doesn't appear on the snake's body"]
- ['P2', 'Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the boundaries of the grid']

## UI Design draft

The UI will use ASCII characters to represent the snake and food. The player can control the snake using arrow keys. The score will be displayed at the top left corner, and a restart button will appear after game over.
