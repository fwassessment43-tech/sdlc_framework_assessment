## Implementation approach

We will utilize the `pygame` library for creating a snake game due to its robust support for graphics and user input handling. This choice ensures that we can easily implement the required features such as grid-based gameplay, arrow key controls, random food generation, collision detection, and score tracking. Additionally, using `pygame` allows us to focus on game logic rather than low-level graphics programming.

    class Game {
        -screen: pygame.Surface
        -clock: pygame.time.Clock
        -snake: Snake
        -food: Food
        -score: int

        +update_score(new_score: int) None

    class Snake {
        -segments: List[Tuple[int, int]]
        -direction: Tuple[int, int]
        +__init__(initial_length: int) None
        +move() None
        +grow(new_segment: Tuple[int, int]) None
        +collide_with_self() bool
    }
    class Food {
        -position: Tuple[int, int]
        +__init__() None
        +generate_new_position() None
        +draw(screen: pygame.Surface) None
    }


## Program call flow

    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    M->>G: initialize_game(width, height)
    G->>S: __init__(initial_length=3)
    G->>F: __init__()
    loop Game Loop
        G->>S: move()
        G->>F: draw(screen)
        G->>G: update_score(new_score)
        G->>G: check_for_food_collision()
        G->>G: handle_game_over()
    end


## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific implementation of the game over logic and the exact method to generate new food positions without overlapping with snake segments are unclear. These will be clarified during development.
