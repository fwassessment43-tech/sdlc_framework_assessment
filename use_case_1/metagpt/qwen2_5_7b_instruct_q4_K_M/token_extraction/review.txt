       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:

               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:

               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:

               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()

## Code Review: game.py
1. Yes. The code is implemented as per the requirements using `pygame` for graphics and user input handling.
2. Yes. The logic appears to be correct, but there are a few minor issues that can be improved:
   - In the `check_food_collision` method, it would be better to use tuple unpacking directly in the condition rather than assigning to `snake_head_position`.
   - The `generate_new_position` method in the `Food` class should take the game instance as an argument.
3. Yes. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" provided.
4. Yes. All necessary functions are implemented, including `move`, `grow`, `collide_with_self`, `is_out_of_bounds`, `change_direction`, `draw`, `update_score`, `check_food_collision`, and `handle_game_over`.
5. Yes. All necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.
6. Yes. Methods from other files are being reused correctly.

## Actions
1. Update the `check_food_collision` method:
   ```python
   def check_food_collision(self) -> bool:
       return self.snake.segments[0] == self.food.position
   ```
2. Modify the `generate_new_position` method in the `Food` class to accept the game instance as an argument and use it appropriately.

               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful

## Code Review: game.py
1. Yes. The code is implemented as per the requirements using `pygame` for graphics and user input handling.
2. Yes. The logic appears to be correct, but there are a few minor issues that can be improved:
   - In the `check_food_collision` method, it would be better to use tuple unpacking for readability.
   - The `generate_new_position` method in the `Food` class should take the `Game` instance as an argument to ensure proper interaction between classes.
3. Yes. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" provided.
4. Yes. All necessary functions are implemented, including `move`, `grow`, `collide_with_self`, `is_out_of_bounds`, and `change_direction`.
5. Yes. All pre-dependencies have been imported.
6. Yes. Methods from other files (`Snake` and `Food`) are reused correctly.

## Actions
1. Refactor the `check_food_collision` method for better readability:
   ```python
   def check_food_collision(self) -> bool:
       snake_head_position = self.snake.segments[0]
       return snake_head_position == self.food.position
   ```
2. Update the `generate_new_position` method in the `Food` class to accept a `Game` instance as an argument and use it to get the screen size:
   ```python
   def generate_new_position(self, game: Game) -> None:
       while True:
           new_position = (20 * (pygame.randint(0, int(game.screen.get_width() / 20))), 20 * (pygame.randint(0, int(game.screen.get_height() / 20))))
           if not any(segment == new_position for segment in game.snake.segments):
               break
       self.position = new_position
   ```

## Code Review Result: LGTM

# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions
## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite game.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.

# Instruction: Based on the context, follow "Format example", write code.

## Code: main.py. Write code with triple quoto, based on the following attentions and context.
1. Only One file: do your best to implement THIS ONLY ONE FILE.
2. COMPLETE CODE: Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.
3. Set default value: If there is any setting, ALWAYS SET A DEFAULT VALUE, ALWAYS USE STRONG TYPE AND EXPLICIT VARIABLE. AVOID circular import.
4. Follow design: YOU MUST FOLLOW "Data structures and interfaces". DONT CHANGE ANY DESIGN. Do not use public member functions that do not exist in your design.
5. CAREFULLY CHECK THAT YOU DONT MISS ANY NECESSARY CLASS/FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.
6. Before using a external variable/module, make sure you import it first.
7. Write out EVERY CODE DETAIL, DON'T LEAVE TODO.






# System
Role: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.
Language: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.
ATTENTION: Use '##' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not '#'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".

               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:

               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')

# Instruction: Based on the actual code situation, follow one of the "Format example". Return only 1 file under review.

## Code Review: Ordered List. Based on the "Code to be Reviewed", provide key, clear, concise, and specific answer. If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.
1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.
2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.
3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?
4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.
5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported
6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?

## Actions: Ordered List. Things that should be done after CR, such as implementing class A and function B

## Code Review Result: str. If the code doesn't have bugs, we don't need to rewrite it, so answer LGTM and stop. ONLY ANSWER LGTM/LBTM.
