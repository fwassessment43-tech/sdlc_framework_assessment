## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

Yes. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" provided.\n4. Yes. All necessary functions are implemented, including `move`, `grow`, `collide_with_self`, `is_out_of_bounds`, `change_direction`, `draw`, `update_score`, `check_food_collision`, and `handle_game_over`.\n5. Yes. All necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.\n6. Yes. Methods from other files are being reused correctly.\n\n## Actions\n1. Update the `check_food_collision` method:\n   ```python\n   def check_food_collision(self) -> bool:\n       return self.snake.segments[0] == self.food.position\n   ```\n2. Modify the `generate_new_position` method in the `Food` class to accept the game instance as an argument and use it appropriately.\n\n## Code Review Result: LGTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

Methods from other files (`Snake` and `Food`) are reused correctly.\n\n## Actions\n1. Refactor the `check_food_collision` method for better readability:\n   ```python\n   def check_food_collision(self) -> bool:\n       snake_head_position = self.snake.segments[0]\n       return snake_head_position == self.food.position\n   ```\n2. Update the `generate_new_position` method in the `Food` class to accept a `Game` instance as an argument and use it to get the screen size:\n   ```python\n   def generate_new_position(self, game: Game) -> None:\n       while True:\n           new_position = (20 * (pygame.randint(0, int(game.screen.get_width() / 20))), 20 * (pygame.randint(0, int(game.screen.get_height() / 20))))\n           if not any(segment == new_position for segment in game.snake.segments):\n               break\n       self.position = new_position\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result: LGTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite game.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## game.py\n...\n```\n'}]
