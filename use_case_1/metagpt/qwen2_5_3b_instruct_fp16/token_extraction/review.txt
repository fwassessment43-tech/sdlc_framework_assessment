# Format example 1
## Code Review: main.py
1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. No, function B is not implemented, ...
5. ...
6. ...

## Actions
1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```
2. Implement function B

1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. No, function B is not implemented, ...
5. ...
6. ...

## Actions
1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```
2. Implement function B

4. No, function B is not implemented, ...
5. ...
6. ...

## Actions
1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```

# Format example 1
## Code Review: collision_handler.py
1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. No, function B is not implemented, ...
5. ...
6. ...

## Actions
1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```
2. Implement function B

# Format example 1
## Code Review: score_display.py
1. No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. No, function B is not implemented, ...
5. ...
6. ...

## Actions
1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.
   ```python
   def handle_events(self):
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               return False
           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
               moved = False
               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                   moved = self.game.move('UP')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                   moved = self.game.move('DOWN')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                   moved = self.game.move('LEFT')
               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                   moved = self.game.move('RIGHT')
               if moved:
                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful
                   self.render()
       return True
   ```
2. Implement function B
