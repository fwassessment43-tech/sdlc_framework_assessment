{"Implementation approach":"We will start by creating a basic structure for our snake game using Python. The main components include setting up the game board, initializing the snake, implementing movement controls, generating food, handling collisions, updating the score, and adding animations. We'll use ASCII characters to represent the snake and food on the grid.","File list":["main.py","game_board.py","snake.py","food.py","collision_handler.py","score_display.py"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class GameBoard {\n        -width: int\n        -height: int\n        +__init__(self, width: int, height: int)\n        +display(self) str\n        +update_grid(self, grid: list[list[str]])\n    }\n    class Snake {\n        -position: tuple[int, int]\n        -direction: str\n        -length: int\n        +__init__(self, position: tuple[int, int], direction: str)\n        +move(self) -> None\n        +grow(self) -> None\n    }\n    class Food {\n        -position: tuple[int, int]\n        +__init__(self, game_board: GameBoard)\n        +generate_food(game_board: GameBoard) -> None\n    }\n    class CollisionHandler {\n        +check_collision(snake: Snake, food: Food, board: GameBoard) -> bool\n    }\n    class ScoreDisplay {\n        -score: int\n        +__init__(self)\n        +display_score(self) str\n    }\n    GameBoard --> Snake\n    GameBoard --> Food\n    GameBoard --> CollisionHandler\n    GameBoard --> ScoreDisplay\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant GB as GameBoard\n    participant S as Snake\n    participant F as Food\n    participant CH as CollisionHandler\n    participant SD as ScoreDisplay\n    GB->>S: __init__(position, direction)\n    GB->>F: generate_food()\n    GB->>CH: check_collision(snake, food, board)\n    S->>GB: move(direction)\n    GB->>S: update_grid(grid)\n    F->>GB: generate_food(game_board)\n    CH->>GB: check_collision(snake, food, board)\n    SD->>GB: display_score()\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the specific ASCII characters to use for snake and food representation."}
