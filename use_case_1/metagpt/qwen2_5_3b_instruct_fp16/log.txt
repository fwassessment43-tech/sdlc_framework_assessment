## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.\n1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n4.
