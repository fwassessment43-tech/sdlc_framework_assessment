# Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption.

## Product Goals

- Create an engaging and responsive game experience
- Ensure high accessibility, providing intuitive controls and easy navigation
- Improve the overall aesthetics of the game

## User Stories

- As a player, I want to be able to control the snake using arrow keys
- As a player, I want to see my score after each game
- As a player, I want to restart the game when it ends
- As a player, I want clear instructions and feedback during gameplay
- As a player, I want visually appealing graphics

## Competitive Analysis

- Snake Game A: Basic controls with no animations or sound effects
- Snake Game B: Offers multiple levels but lacks intuitive UI design
- Snake Game C: Has smooth animations and responsive controls but is not accessible to all users
- Snake Game D: Beautiful graphics but requires a high-end device for optimal performance
- Snake Game E: Intuitive controls, clear instructions, and simple gameplay mechanics
- Snake Game F: Offers multiple levels with sound effects and animations, but the UI can be overwhelming
- Our Target Product: Intuitive controls, responsive design, beautiful graphics, and accessible to all users

## Requirement Analysis

The requirements for the snake game can be categorized into several key areas: Game Board, Snake Initialization, Snake Movement, Food Generation, Collision Handling, Score Display, Game Over Condition, Graphics and User Interface, Animations and Effects. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing game that adheres to all these requirements.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Create a grid-based game board with dimensions of 10x10 and display it on the screen']
- ['P0', 'Initialize the snake at position (5, 5) facing right with an initial length of 3 segments']
- ['P0', 'Implement arrow key controls to move the snake continuously in a chosen direction']
- ['P0', "Generate food at random positions that do not overlap with the snake's body"]
- ['P0', 'Detect and handle collisions between the snake, game board boundaries, its own body, and food']
- ['P1', 'Implement a scoring system that increments based on consuming food']
- ['P2', 'Display the current score on the screen after each move']
- ['P0', 'Design an intuitive user interface with clear instructions and feedback during gameplay']
- ['P0', 'Add animations for snake movement, growth, collisions, and food consumption']

## UI Design draft

The UI will include a 10x10 grid representing the game board. The snake will be represented by ASCII characters moving in a straight line towards the right direction. Food will be displayed as an 'O' character. A score counter will be located at the top left corner of the screen, and restart buttons will appear after each game over scenario.
