Arrow keys change direction, but the snake cannot reverse directly. Food appears randomly, avoiding the snake's body. Collisions with walls or self end the game. Eating food grows the snake and increments the score. The UI must display the grid, snake, food, score, and game over state, with simple ASCII graphics and optional animations for movement and growth.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement a 10x10 grid and initialize the snake at the center moving right."],["P0","Handle continuous movement and arrow key controls, preventing 180° turns."],["P0","Generate food at random positions not occupied by the snake."],["P0","Detect collisions with walls, self, and food; trigger growth and score updates."],["P0","Display score, game over message, and provide a restart option."]],"UI Design draft":"The interface will be console‑based: a 10x10 grid rendered with characters. The snake will be represented by 'O' for the head and 'o' for the body. Food will be '*'. The score will appear at the top of the screen. Upon game over, a centered message will show the final score and prompt the player to press 'R' to restart.","Anything UNCLEAR":""}
