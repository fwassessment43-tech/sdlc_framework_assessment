Here is a new customer's task: # Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]


Based on the provided test report, there are two bugs in the code that are causing problems:

1. The `GUI` class does not have a `pack()` method, which is being called in the main function. This is causing the error message "AttributeError: 'GUI' object has no attribute 'pack'" to be displayed.
2. The `GameOver` class is using the `gui` variable to access the `score_label` widget, but this variable is not defined anywhere in the code. This is likely causing a different error message or a crash of the program.

The bug is located in the `main.py` file, specifically in line 6, where it tries to call the `pack()` method on an object of type `GUI`, but `GUI` does not have a `pack()` method defined. Therefore, the error message "AttributeError: 'GUI' object has no attribute 'pack'" is displayed.

To fix this bug, you can either add a `pack()` method to the `GUI` class or modify the code that calls the `pack()` method so that it uses an appropriate method or property of the `GUI` object instead.
