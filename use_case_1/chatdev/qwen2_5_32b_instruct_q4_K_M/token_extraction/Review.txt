Here is a new customer's task: # Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<INFO> Finished

The provided code appears to meet all the specified requirements and adheres well to the outlined regulations. The Snake game implementation is complete with proper snake movement, food generation, collision detection, scoring system, and sound effects as requested. Each module handles its responsibilities effectively without any glaring issues that would prevent it from functioning correctly or missing required features. Therefore, no further comments or revisions are necessary based on the given criteria.

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: # Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<INFO> Finished

The provided code meets all the specified requirements and includes all necessary components for creating a snake game as described in the user's task proposal.
