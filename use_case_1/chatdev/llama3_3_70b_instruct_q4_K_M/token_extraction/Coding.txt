
[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: # Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Based on the requirements of the task, I will lay out the core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the implementation of the snake game in Python.

The following are the core classes and their purposes:
- `SnakeGame`: The main class that initializes and controls the game.
- `Snake`: A class representing the snake, handling its movement and growth.
- `Food`: A class generating food at random positions on the game board.
- `GameBoard`: A class creating a grid-based game board.

The following are the core functions and methods:
- `__init__`: Initializes the game board, snake, and food.
- `draw_game_board`: Draws the game board on the screen.
- `move_snake`: Updates the snake's position based on user input or automatic movement.
- `generate_food`: Generates food at a random position on the game board.
- `check_collision`: Checks for collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries, its own body, or the food.
- `update_score`: Updates the score when the snake consumes food.
