Here is a new customer's task: # Prompt: Create a snake game in Python
## Requirements:
### Game Board:
- Create a grid-based game board.
- Define the dimensions of the grid (e.g., 10x10).
- Display the grid on the screen.
### Snake Initialization:
- Place the snake on the game board.
- Define the initial length and starting position of the snake.
- Choose a direction for the snake to start moving immediately, without user input (e.g., right).
### Snake Movement:
- Implement arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Ensure the snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
- Update the snake’s position on the grid.
### Food Generation:
- Generate food at random positions on the game board.
- Ensure food doesn’t appear on the snake’s body.
### Collision Handling:
- Detect collisions between the snake and the game board boundaries.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and its body.
- Detect collisions between the snake’s head and the food.
### Snake Growth:
- Increase the length of the snake when it consumes food, adding a new segment to the snake’s body.
### Score Display:
- Implement a scoring system.
- Display the current score on the screen.
### Game Over Condition:
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with the boundaries.
- Trigger a game over scenario when the snake collides with its own body.
- Display a game over message.
- Allow the player to restart the game.
### Graphics and User Interface:
- Use graphics or ASCII characters to represent the snake and food.
- Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions.
### Animations and Effects:
- Add animations for snake movement and growth.
- Implement visual effects for collisions and food consumption..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Okay, let's analyze the provided test report and pinpoint the bug.

**Bug Summary:**

The core issue is a `pygame.error: font not initialized`. This means that Pygame's font system hasn't been properly initialized before the code attempts to use it.

**Location:**

The error occurs in the `ui.py` file, specifically on line 15: `self.font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)`.

**Root Cause:**

The Pygame font system needs to be initialized *before* you can create `Font` objects.  The standard way to do this is to call `pygame.init()` *before* any other Pygame functions are used.

**How to fix it:**

Add `pygame.init()` at the beginning of your `main.py` file, before you create any Pygame objects or call any Pygame functions.

```python
import pygame
from food import Food
from grid import Grid
from ui import UI
from snake import Snake

pygame.init()  # Initialize Pygame

class Game:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        # ... rest of your code ...
```

By adding `pygame.init()`, you ensure that all Pygame modules, including the font module, are properly initialized before being used. This will resolve the `pygame.error: font not initialized` error.
