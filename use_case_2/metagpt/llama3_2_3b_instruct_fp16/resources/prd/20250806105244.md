## Programming Language

Python

## Original Requirements

Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

## Product Goals

- Create an engaging user experience
- Improve accessibility, be responsive
- More beautiful UI

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to report issues at the university campus
- As a user, I want to view and modify all 'open' and 'active' tickets
- As a helpdesk staff, I want to view all 'open', 'active' and 'closed' tickets
- As a helpdesk staff, I want to change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'
- As a user, I want to exchange messages related to each ticket

## Competitive Analysis

- Other ticket management systems lack the ability for users to report issues at a university campus
- Some ticket management systems have beautiful UI but lack responsiveness
- None of the other competitive products provide the same level of user engagement as our application
