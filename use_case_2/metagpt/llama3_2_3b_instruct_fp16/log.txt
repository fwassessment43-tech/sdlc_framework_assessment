The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

Google\'s style guide. Here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  The `Ticket` class is defined inside the `app.py` file, which is not a good practice. It should be moved to its own separate file.\n2.  The `create_ticket`, `update_ticket_status`, and `assign_ticket_to_staff` functions in `routes.py` are not properly imported or used in `app.py`. They should be imported and used correctly.\n3.  The `TicketManager` class is defined inside the `app.py` file, which is not a good practice. It should be moved to its own separate file.\n4.  There are no error handling mechanisms in place for potential errors that may occur during database operations or API calls.\n\nHere\'s an updated version of the code with these suggestions applied:\n\n```## models.py\n"""\nTicket Management System Models\n\nThis file defines classes for Ticket, User, HelpdeskStaff, and TicketManager.\n"""\n\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\n\nclass Ticket(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)\n    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)\n    status = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)\n\nclass User(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)\n    email = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)\n\nclass HelpdeskStaff(User):\n    tickets = db.relationship(\'Ticket\', backref=\'staff\', lazy=True)\n\nclass TicketManager:\n    def __init__(self, app):\n        self.app = app\n        self.db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n```\n\n```## routes.py\n"""\nTicket Management System Routes\n\nThis file defines API endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving tickets.\n"""\n\nfrom flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify\nfrom models import TicketManager, Ticket, User, HelpdeskStaff\n\nticket_manager_blueprint = Blueprint(\'ticket_manager\', __name__)\n\n@ticket_manager_blueprint.route(\'/tickets\', methods=[\'POST\'])\ndef create_ticket_view():\n    # Create a new ticket\n    pass\n\n@ticket_manager_blueprint.route(\'/tickets/<int:ticket_id>\', methods=[\'PUT\'])\ndef update_ticket_status_view(ticket_id):\n    # Update the status of a ticket\n    pass\n\n@ticket_manager_blueprint.route(\'/tickets/<int:ticket_id>/assign\', methods=[\'PUT\'])\ndef assign_ticket_to_staff_view(ticket_id):\n    # Assign a ticket to a staff member\n    pass\n\n@ticket_manager_blueprint.route(\'/users/<int:user_id>/tickets\', methods=[\'GET\'])\ndef get_user_tickets_view(user_id):\n    # Get the tickets assigned to a user\n    pass\n```\n\n```## app.py\n"""\nTicket Management System Application\n\nThis file contains the main application logic and routes.\n"""\n\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\nfrom models import TicketManager\nfrom routes import ticket_manager_blueprint\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\nticket_manager = TicketManager(app)\n\n# Register the blueprint\napp.register_blueprint(ticket_manager_blueprint)\n```\n\n```## forms.py\n"""\nTicket Management System Forms\n\nThis file defines forms for user input validation.\n"""\n\nfrom flask_wtf import FlaskForm\nfrom wtforms import StringField, TextField, SubmitField\n\nclass TicketForm(FlaskForm):\n    title = StringField(\'Title\', validators=[DataRequired()])\n    description = TextField(\'Description\', validators=[DataRequired()])\n    status = StringField(\'Status\', validators=[DataRequired()])\n\nclass UserForm(FlaskForm):\n    name = StringField(\'Name\', validators=[DataRequired()])\n    email = StringField(\'Email\', validators=[DataRequired()])\n```\n\nNote that this is just a starting point, and you will need to implement the actual logic for each endpoint and form.

No, we should fix the logic of class A due to ...\n2. ...\n3. ...\n4. No, function B is not implemented, ...\n5. ...\n6. ...\n\n## Actions\n1. Fix the `handle_events` method to update the game state only if a move is successful.\n   ```python\n   def handle_events(self):\n       for event in pygame.event.get():\n           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n               return False\n           if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n               moved = False\n               if event.key == pygame.K_UP:\n                   moved = self.game.move(\'UP\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:\n                   moved = self.game.move(\'DOWN\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\n                   moved = self.game.move(\'LEFT\')\n               elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\n                   moved = self.game.move(\'RIGHT\')\n               if moved:\n                   # Update the game state only if a move was successful\n                   self.render()\n       return True\n   ```\n2. Implement function B\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Format example 2\n## Code Review: forms.py\n1. Yes.\n2. Yes.\n3. Yes.\n4. Yes.\n5. Yes.\n6.

Return only 1 file under review.\n\n## Code Review: Ordered List. Based on the "Code to be Reviewed", provide key, clear, concise, and specific answer. If any answer is no, explain how to fix it step by step.\n1. Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported?
