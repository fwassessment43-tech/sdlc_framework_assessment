{"Implementation approach":"We will utilize the Flask web framework to develop a user-friendly interface for reporting and managing tickets. The application will be built using Python, with a MySQL database for storing ticket information. We will also implement a microservices architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.","File list":["app.py","models.py","routes.py","templates/index.html","static/style.css"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class User {\n        -id: int\n        -username: str\n        -email: str\n        +__init__(id: int, username: str, email: str)\n    }\n    class Ticket {\n        -id: int\n        -title: str\n        -description: str\n        -status: str\n        +__init__(id: int, title: str, description: str, status: str)\n    }\n    class HelpDeskStaff {\n        -id: int\n        -username: str\n        -email: str\n        +__init__(id: int, username: str, email: str)\n    }\n    class TicketManager {\n        -tickets: list[Ticket]\n        +assign_status(ticket_id: int, status: str)\n        +exchange_messages(ticket_id: int, message: str)\n        +analyze_data()\n    }\n    User --> Ticket\n    HelpDeskStaff --> Ticket\n    TicketManager --> Ticket\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant H as HelpDeskStaff\n    participant T as Ticket\n    participant TM as TicketManager\n    U->>T: report_issue(title: str, description: str)\n    T->>TM: create_ticket(title: str, description: str)\n    TM->>T: assign_status(status: str)\n    H->>TM: view_tickets()\n    TM->>H: return tickets\n    H->>T: exchange_messages(message: str)\n    T->>TM: update_status(status: str)\n    TM->>U: notify_user(update: str)\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification needed on the specific database schema and microservices architecture, as well as the implementation of user authentication and authorization."}
