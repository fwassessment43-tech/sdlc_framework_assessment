The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n   - Yes, the `app.py` file implements the required functionality for creating tickets and comments, and fetching analytics data via RESTful endpoints. However, there is a minor issue with the import statement of `analytics_service`. It should be corrected as follows:\n     ```python\n     from .analytics_service import AnalyticsService  # Assuming this is part of the same package.\n     ```\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n   - The code logic appears mostly correct but has a minor flaw in handling session management. Each request should have its own session to avoid potential issues with concurrent requests:\n     ```python\n     @app.route(\'/ticket\', methods=[\'POST\'])\n     def create_ticket():\n         data = request.get_json()\n         title = data[\'title\']\n         description = data[\'description\']\n\n         # Use a context manager for the session\n         with Session() as session:\n             new_ticket = TicketModel(title=title, description=description)\n             session.add(new_ticket)\n             session.commit()\n\n         return jsonify({\'ticket_id\': new_ticket.id}), 201\n\n     @app.route(\'/comment\', methods=[\'POST\'])\n     def add_comment():\n         data = request.get_json()\n         ticket_id = data[\'ticket_id\']\n         content = data[\'content\']\n\n         with Session() as session:\n             comment = Comment(content=content)\n             ticket = session.query(TicketModel).filter_by(id=ticket_id).first()\n\n             if not ticket:\n                 return jsonify({\'error\': \'Ticket not found\'}), 404\n\n             ticket.comments.append(comment)\n             session.add(ticket)\n             session.commit()\n\n         return jsonify({\'comment_id\': comment.id}), 201\n     ```\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n   - Yes, it does. The `TicketModel` and `Comment` classes are defined as per the UML diagram provided.\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n   - All required routes and their corresponding logic have been implemented according to the task list.\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n   - Yes, all necessary dependencies are imported correctly.\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n   - The `AnalyticsService` class is referenced but should have a proper import statement as mentioned in point 1.\n\n## Actions\n1. Fix the import statement for `analytics_service`.\n2. Use context managers (`with Session()`) to manage sessions properly within each request handler function.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite app.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## app.py\n...\n```\n'}]

Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n   - The code is mostly in line with the requirements but needs some adjustments:\n     1. Ensure that `analytics_service` module is correctly imported and its methods are defined according to the design.\n     2. Add missing imports for `jsonify`, which is used in the response.\n\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n   - The code logic appears mostly correct but could be improved:\n     1. Ensure that the session commit and rollback are handled properly in case of exceptions.\n     2. Add error handling for database operations to ensure robustness.\n\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n   - Yes, the `TicketModel` and `Comment` classes match the defined data structure and interface.\n\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n   - The necessary routes are implemented (`create_ticket`, `add_comment`, analytics-related endpoints). However:\n     1. Ensure that `AnalyticsService` methods (`get_resolution_times`, `get_active_tickets_by_category`) are defined in the `analytics_service.py`.\n\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n   - The code is missing an import for `jsonify`. This should be added at the top of the file:\n     ```python\n     from flask import Flask, request, jsonify  # Add this line if it\'s missing.\n     ```\n\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n   - Yes, the `AnalyticsService` class is imported and used to call its methods.\n\n## Actions\n1. Ensure that `analytics_service.py` contains definitions for `get_resolution_times` and `get_active_tickets_by_category`.\n2. Add error handling around database operations in routes.\n3. Import `jsonify` if it\'s not already included.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite app.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## app.py\n...\n```\n'}]

Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n   - No, the `routes.py` file should not contain database setup logic (creation of engine and sessionmaker). This is better suited for `app.py`. The function `get_session()` can be moved to a utility module or kept in `app.py`.\n\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n   - Yes, the logic within the routes themselves appears to be correct and follows the expected behavior for creating tickets and adding comments.\n\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n   - Yes, it does follow the defined data structures and interfaces as outlined in the class diagram provided.\n\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n   - No, `routes.py` should not contain any route definitions or logic that belongs to Flask app initialization which is typically found in `app.py`. The routes for creating tickets and adding comments are correctly defined but they shouldn\'t be here.\n\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n   - No, the code does not import `Flask` from `flask`, which is required since it uses Flask decorators (`@app.route`). Also, `Session` should be imported from `sqlalchemy.orm`.\n\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n   - Yes, the classes `TicketModel` and `Comment` are correctly imported from `models.py`. However, the session management logic could be better abstracted or shared between `app.py` and `routes.py`.\n\n## Actions\n1. Move database setup code (creation of engine and sessionmaker) to `app.py`.\n2. Import `Flask` in `routes.py` if it is intended to define routes here.\n3. Consider moving route definitions back into `app.py`, as per the initial design, to maintain a clean separation between application logic and routing.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite routes.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE.

Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n   - The `routes.py` file is intended to handle HTTP requests and responses but currently does not import necessary dependencies from Flask for route definitions or session management which are defined in `app.py`. To align with the requirement:\n     1. Import `Flask`, `request`, and `jsonify` from `flask`.\n     2. Move the logic of creating tickets and adding comments into functions that can be called by routes.\n     3. Ensure session management is consistent across files.\n\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n   - The function `get_session` recreates the engine and sessionmaker every time it\'s called which is inefficient and not recommended for production use. It should be moved outside of this file or made a singleton pattern.\n\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n   - Yes, the functions in `routes.py` are correctly interacting with the `TicketModel` and `Comment` classes as defined in `models.py`.\n\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n   - The functions `create_ticket`, `add_comment`, and `get_session` are implemented but they need to be integrated into Flask routes.\n\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n   - No, the file should import `Flask`, `request`, and `jsonify` from `flask`. Additionally, it needs to import session management utilities from SQLAlchemy.\n\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n   - The code is trying to reuse models defined in `models.py` but does not integrate with Flask routes as expected. It should be refactored into a structure that can be used by the main application logic (`app.py`).\n\n## Actions\n1. Import necessary dependencies for route definitions and session management.\n2. Refactor functions to fit within Flask\'s routing system, ensuring they are called appropriately from `app.py`.\n3. Move or refactor `get_session()` to avoid recreating engine and sessionmaker on each call.\n\n```python\n## routes.py\nfrom flask import request, jsonify\nfrom models import TicketModel, Comment\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\ndef create_ticket():\n    data = request.get_json()\n    title = data[\'title\']\n    description = data[\'description\']\n\n    with get_session() as session:\n        try:\n            new_ticket = TicketModel(title=title, description=description)\n            session.add(new_ticket)\n            session.commit()\n            return jsonify({\'ticket_id\': new_ticket.id}), 201\n        except Exception as e:\n            session.rollback()\n            return jsonify({\'error\': str(e)}), 500\n\ndef add_comment():\n    data = request.get_json()\n    ticket_id = data[\'ticket_id\']\n    content = data[\'content\']\n\n    with get_session() as session:\n        try:\n            comment = Comment(content=content)\n            ticket = session.query(TicketModel).filter_by(id=ticket_id).first()\n\n            if not ticket:\n                return jsonify({\'error\': \'Ticket not found\'}), 404\n\n            ticket.comments.append(comment)\n            session.add(ticket)\n            session.commit()\n            return jsonify({\'comment_id\': comment.id}), 201\n        except Exception as e:\n            session.rollback()\n            return jsonify({\'error\': str(e)}), 500\n\ndef get_session():\n    from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n    \n    DATABASE_URI = \'sqlite:///tickets.db\'\n    engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URI)\n    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n    \n    return Session()\n```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n   - Yes, the `AnalyticsService` class is correctly defined with methods for fetching resolution times and active tickets by category. It initializes a database session and closes it upon deletion of an instance.\n\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n   - The logic appears correct given the provided context. However, the calculation of `resolution_time` assumes that `updated_at` is always set when a ticket status changes to \'closed\'. This might not be true if `updated_at` is only updated on explicit updates and not on status change. To fix this:\n     ```python\n     result = [{"ticket_id": t.id, "resolution_time": (t.updated_at - t.created_at).total_seconds() if t.status == \'closed\' else None} for t in tickets]\n     ```\n\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n   - Yes, it follows the defined structure with `TicketModel` being used to fetch data from the database.\n\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n   - All required methods (`get_resolution_times`, `get_active_tickets_by_category`) are implemented as per the provided requirements.\n\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n   - Yes, all necessary dependencies have been imported for SQLAlchemy and models.\n\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n   - The `TicketModel` class is used correctly from the `models.py`. No issues found here.\n\n## Actions\n1. Ensure that `updated_at` is updated when a ticket status changes to \'closed\' or adjust the logic in `get_resolution_times` as suggested above.\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite analytics_service.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE.

Is the code implemented as per the requirements? If not, how to achieve it? Analyse it step by step.\n   - Yes, the `AnalyticsService` class is correctly defined and implements methods for fetching resolution times and active tickets based on the provided specifications.\n\n2. Is the code logic completely correct? If there are errors, please indicate how to correct them.\n   - The logic seems mostly correct but can be improved in terms of handling sessions more efficiently. For instance, session management should ideally be handled within each method rather than at the class level to ensure that sessions are closed properly after their use.\n\n3. Does the existing code follow the "Data structures and interfaces"?\n   - Yes, `AnalyticsService` follows the specified interface with methods `get_resolution_times()` and `get_active_tickets_by_category()`. The data structures used in these methods align with the expected output format.\n\n4. Are all functions implemented? If there is no implementation, please indicate how to achieve it step by step.\n   - Yes, both required functions are implemented within the class as per the requirements.\n\n5. Have all necessary pre-dependencies been imported? If not, indicate which ones need to be imported\n   - All necessary imports for SQLAlchemy and models have been included at the top of the file.\n\n6. Are methods from other files being reused correctly?\n   - Yes, `TicketModel` is correctly referenced from `models.py`.\n\n## Actions\n1. Modify session handling in `AnalyticsService` methods to ensure sessions are closed after their use.\n   ```python\n   def get_resolution_times(self) -> list[dict]:\n       with self.session() as session:\n           tickets = session.query(TicketModel).all()\n           result = [\n               {"ticket_id": t.id, "resolution_time": (t.updated_at - t.created_at).total_seconds() if t.status == \'closed\' else None}\n               for t in tickets\n           ]\n       return result\n\n   def get_active_tickets_by_category(self) -> list[dict]:\n       with self.session() as session:\n           tickets = session.query(TicketModel).filter_by(status=\'open\').all()\n           result = [{"ticket_id": t.id, "category": t.status} for t in tickets]\n       return result\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result\nLBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite analytics_service.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## analytics_service.py\n...\n```\n'}]
