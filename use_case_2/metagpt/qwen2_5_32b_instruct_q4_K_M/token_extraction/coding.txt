Set default value: If there is any setting, ALWAYS SET A DEFAULT VALUE, ALWAYS USE STRONG TYPE AND EXPLICIT VARIABLE. AVOID circular import.\n4. Follow design: YOU MUST FOLLOW "Data structures and interfaces". DONT CHANGE ANY DESIGN. Do not use public member functions that do not exist in your design.\n5. CAREFULLY CHECK THAT YOU DONT MISS ANY NECESSARY CLASS/FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.\n6. Before using a external variable/module, make sure you import it first.\n7. Write out EVERY CODE DETAIL, DON\'T LEAVE TODO.\n\n
