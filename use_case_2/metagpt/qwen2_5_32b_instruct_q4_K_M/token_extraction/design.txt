\n## context\n{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue. The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.","Product Goals":["Create an efficient ticket management system that streamlines communication between users and helpdesk staff","Ensure easy access and use for both simple users and helpdesk staff, with clear visualizations of ticket statuses and analytics","Implement a robust database and microservices architecture to support the application\'s functionalities"],"User Stories":["As a user, I want to easily report an issue so that it can be resolved quickly by the helpdesk team.","As a helpdesk staff member, I need to view all tickets in real-time to manage them effectively and provide timely resolutions.","As a simple user, I should be able to modify my ticket details if necessary before or during the resolution process.","As a helpdesk staff member, I want to analyze ticket data over time to identify trends and improve service delivery."],"Competitive Analysis":["ServiceDesk Plus: Comprehensive ITSM solution with advanced analytics but lacks user-friendly interface for simple users","Freshservice: User-friendly but limited in customization options for specific university needs","Zendesk: Strong customer support platform, highly customizable but expensive and may include unnecessary features"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\\n    title \\"Reach and engagement of campaigns\\"\\n    x-axis \\"Low Reach\\" --> \\"High Reach\\"\\n    y-axis \\"Low Engagement\\" --> \\"High Engagement\\"\\n    quadrant-1 \\"We should expand\\"\\n    quadrant-2 \\"Need to promote\\"\\n    quadrant-3 \\"Re-evaluate\\"\\n    quadrant-4 \\"May be improved\\"\\n    \\"ServiceDesk Plus\\": [0.6, 0.7]\\n    \\"Freshservice\\": [0.8, 0.5]\\n    \\"Zendesk\\": [0.9, 0.4]\\n    \\"Our Target Product\\": [0.7, 0.6]","Requirement Analysis":"The project requires a ticket management system with user and helpdesk interfaces, a database for storing tickets and interactions, and microservices for data analysis. The system must support basic CRUD operations on tickets and allow users to report issues while enabling helpdesk staff to manage them efficiently.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Design and implement the ticket management GUI that supports user and helpdesk functionalities."],["P1","Develop a database schema for storing tickets, interactions, and analytics data."],["P2","Implement microservices for providing analytics on ticket data such as resolution times, active tickets by category, etc."],["P3","Ensure the system is scalable and can handle an increasing number of users and tickets over time."]],"UI Design draft":"The UI will feature a clean dashboard with sections for reporting new issues (for simple users) and managing all tickets (for helpdesk staff). Each ticket detail page will allow adding comments, changing status, and viewing history. Analytics pages will display charts and graphs summarizing ticket data.","Anything UNCLEAR":"Clarification on the specific GUI framework to be used is needed for more detailed UI design."}\n\n-----\n\n## format example\n[CONTENT]\n{\n    "Implementation approach": "We will ...",\n    "File list": [\n        "main.py",\n        "game.py"\n    ],\n    "Data structures and interfaces": "\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -SearchEngine search_engine\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class SearchEngine {\\n        -Index index\\n        -Ranking ranking\\n        -Summary summary\\n        +search(query: str) str\\n    }\\n    class Index {\\n        -KnowledgeBase knowledge_base\\n        +create_index(data: dict)\\n        +query_index(query: str) list\\n    }\\n    class Ranking {\\n        +rank_results(results: list) list\\n    }\\n    class Summary {\\n        +summarize_results(results: list) str\\n    }\\n    class KnowledgeBase {\\n        +update(data: dict)\\n        +fetch_data(query: str) dict\\n    }\\n    Main --> SearchEngine\\n    SearchEngine --> Index\\n    SearchEngine --> Ranking\\n    SearchEngine --> Summary\\n    Index --> KnowledgeBase\\n",\n    "Program call flow": "\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant SE as SearchEngine\\n    participant I as Index\\n    participant R as Ranking\\n    participant S as Summary\\n    participant KB as KnowledgeBase\\n    M->>SE: search(query)\\n    SE->>I: query_index(query)\\n    I->>KB: fetch_data(query)\\n    KB-->>I: return data\\n    I-->>SE: return results\\n    SE->>R: rank_results(results)\\n    R-->>SE: return ranked_results\\n    SE->>S: summarize_results(ranked_results)\\n    S-->>SE: return summary\\n    SE-->>M: return summary\\n",\n    "Anything UNCLEAR": "Clarification needed on third-party API integration, ..."\n}\n[/CONTENT]\n\n## nodes: "<node>: <type>  # <instruction>"\n- Implementation approach: <class \'str\'>  # Analyze the difficult points of the requirements, select the appropriate open-source framework\n- File list: typing.List[str]  # Only need relative paths.
