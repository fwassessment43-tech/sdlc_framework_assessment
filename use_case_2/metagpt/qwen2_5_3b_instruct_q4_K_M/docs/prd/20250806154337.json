{"Language":"en_us","Programming Language":"Python","Original Requirements":"Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue. The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select analysis to perform.","Product Goals":["Create an intuitive and user-friendly ticket management system","Ensure seamless integration between users and helpdesk staff","Provide robust analytics for better decision-making"],"User Stories":["As a simple user, I want to be able to report new issues and view all open tickets.","As a simple user, I want to modify the details of an existing ticket.","As a helpdesk staff member, I want to see all open, active, and closed tickets.","As a helpdesk staff member, I can change the status of a ticket from 'open' to 'active' or 'closed'.","As a simple user, I want to communicate with the helpdesk staff via messages within each ticket.","As a helpdesk staff member, I want to analyze data related to tickets based on various criteria."],"Competitive Analysis":["TicketTracker: A basic web application that lacks advanced analytics features","HelpDeskPro: Offers more functionalities but has a complex user interface","CampusSupport: Provides good communication channels between users and staff, but limited data visualization","TechIssuesHub: Has robust analytics features but is not as intuitive for new users","UniversityPortal: A comprehensive portal that integrates many other services, including ticket management"],"Competitive Quadrant Chart":"quadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]","Requirement Analysis":"The ticket management system requires a robust database to store all the data related to tickets and user interactions. The application should allow simple users to report new issues and view open tickets, while helpdesk staff can modify existing tickets, change their status, and communicate with users via messages. Additionally, the system must provide advanced analytics functionalities for better decision-making.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement a database schema that supports ticket management operations"],["P1","Create user interface components for simple users to report issues and view tickets"],["P2","Develop functionality for helpdesk staff to modify, change status, and communicate with users within the application"],["P3","Design and implement data visualization services for analytics purposes"],["P4","Integrate all functionalities via an API interface with the database"]],"UI Design draft":"The UI should be clean and intuitive.
