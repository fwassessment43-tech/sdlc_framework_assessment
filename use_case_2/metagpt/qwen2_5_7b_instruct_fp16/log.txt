The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

Yes. The code is implemented as per the requirements.\n2. Yes. The code logic appears correct. However, there are a few improvements that can be made for better readability and error handling:\n   - In `report_ticket`, add a check to ensure the user exists in the database before proceeding with ticket creation.\n   - In `send_message`, add a similar check to ensure the ticket exists.\n3. Yes. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" defined in the class diagram.\n4. Yes. All functions are implemented as required.\n5. Yes. All necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.\n6. Yes. Methods from other files (e.g., `models.Ticket.get_ticket_by_id`, `models.User.get_user_by_username`) are being reused correctly.\n\n## Actions\n1. Add user existence check in `report_ticket`:\n   ```python\n   @router.post("/report", response_model=models.Ticket, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)\n   def report_ticket(ticket_data: TicketCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       user = models.User.get_user_by_username(db, ticket_data.user_id)\n       if not user:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")\n       \n       new_ticket = models.Ticket(title=ticket_data.title, description=ticket_data.description)\n       new_ticket.user_id = user.id\n       db.add(new_ticket)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(new_ticket)\n       return new_ticket\n   ```\n2.

Yes. The code is implemented as per the requirements.\n2. Yes. The code logic appears correct. However, there are a few improvements that can be made for better clarity and error handling:\n   - In `report_ticket`, add validation to ensure `ticket_data.user_id` exists in the database.\n   - In `send_message`, validate if the ticket belongs to the user attempting to send a message.\n3. Yes. The existing code follows the "Data structures and interfaces" defined in the class diagram.\n4. Yes. All necessary functions are implemented as per the requirements.\n5. Yes. All required pre-dependencies have been imported.\n6. Yes. Methods from other files (e.g., `models.Ticket.get_ticket_by_id`, `models.User.get_user_by_username`) are being reused correctly.\n\n## Actions\n1. Add validation in `report_ticket` to ensure `ticket_data.user_id` exists in the database:\n   ```python\n   @router.post("/report", response_model=models.Ticket, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)\n   def report_ticket(ticket_data: TicketCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       user = models.User.get_user_by_username(db, ticket_data.user_id)\n       if not user:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")\n       \n       new_ticket = models.Ticket(title=ticket_data.title, description=ticket_data.description)\n       new_ticket.user_id = user.id\n       db.add(new_ticket)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(new_ticket)\n       return new_ticket\n   ```\n2. Add validation in `send_message` to ensure the ticket belongs to the user:\n   ```python\n   @router.post("/{ticket_id}/messages", response_model=models.Message, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)\n   def send_message(ticket_id: int, message_data: models.MessageCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       ticket = models.Ticket.get_ticket_by_id(db, ticket_id)\n       if not ticket:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Ticket not found")\n       \n       user = models.User.get_user_by_username(db, ticket.user_id)\n       if message_data.user_id != user.id:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="You are not authorized to send a message for this ticket")\n       \n       new_message = models.Message(content=message_data.content)\n       new_message.ticket_id = ticket.id\n       db.add(new_message)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(new_message)\n       return new_message\n   ```\n\n## Code Review Result: LGTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite routes/tickets.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## routes/tickets.py\n...\n```\n'}]

No, the `report_ticket` function is implemented incorrectly. It should use the `User.get_user_by_id` method instead of `User.get_user_by_username`. The correct implementation would be:\n   ```python\n   @router.post("/report_ticket", response_model=models.Ticket, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)\n   def report_ticket(ticket_data: models.TicketCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       """\n       Report a new ticket.\n       \n       :param ticket_data: TicketCreate object containing title and description\n       :param db: Database session\n       :return: Created ticket\n       """\n       user = models.User.get_user_by_id(db, ticket_data.user_id)\n       if not user:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")\n       \n       new_ticket = models.Ticket(title=ticket_data.title, description=ticket_data.description)\n       new_ticket.user_id = user.id\n       db.add(new_ticket)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(new_ticket)\n       return new_ticket\n   ```\n2. No, the `modify_user` function is not implemented as per the requirements. It should update the user\'s details and then commit the changes to the database.

Yes.\n4. The `modify_user` function is missing an implementation.\n5. Yes.\n6. Yes.\n\n## Actions\n1. Implement the corrected `report_ticket` function as described above.\n2.

Yes. The `report_ticket` function is implemented correctly but has a redundant implementation compared to the `routes/tickets.py` file. This can be simplified by removing the duplicate code in this file.\n2. Yes. The logic for handling user login, reporting tickets, modifying ticket status, and modifying user details appears correct.\n3. Yes. The data structures and interfaces are followed correctly.\n4. No, the function `get_user_by_id` is not implemented in the models module. This needs to be added.\n5. Yes, all necessary pre-dependencies have been imported.\n6. Yes, methods from other files (e.g., `models.User.get_user_by_username`, `models.Ticket.get_ticket_by_id`) are being reused correctly.\n\n## Actions\n1. Remove the redundant implementation of `report_ticket` in `routes/users.py`.\n   ```python\n   @router.post("/report_ticket", response_model=models.Ticket, status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)\n   def report_ticket(ticket_data: models.TicketCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):\n       """\n       Report a new ticket.\n       \n       :param ticket_data: TicketCreate object containing title and description\n       :param db: Database session\n       :return: Created ticket\n       """\n       user = models.User.get_user_by_username(db, ticket_data.user_id)\n       if not user:\n           raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")\n       \n       new_ticket = models.Ticket(title=ticket_data.title, description=ticket_data.description)\n       new_ticket.user_id = user.id\n       db.add(new_ticket)\n       db.commit()\n       db.refresh(new_ticket)\n       return new_ticket\n   ```\n2. Implement the `get_user_by_id` function in the models module.\n\n## Code Review Result: LBTM\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite routes/users.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE.
