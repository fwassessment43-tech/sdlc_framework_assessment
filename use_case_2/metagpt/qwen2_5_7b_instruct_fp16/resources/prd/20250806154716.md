## Original Requirements

Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue. Use python programming language.

## Product Goals

- Provide an intuitive user interface for both simple users and helpdesk staff
- Ensure efficient data management and retrieval through a robust database system
- Offer real-time analytics to helpdesk staff to manage tickets more effectively

## User Stories

- As a simple user, I want to be able to report an issue with my dormitory's internet connection.
- As a simple user, I want to view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets related to me.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to see all open, active, and closed tickets for easy management.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to change the status of a ticket from 'open' to 'active' or from 'active' to 'closed'.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to exchange messages with users related to their tickets.

## Competitive Analysis

- CampusHelp: Provides basic ticket management but lacks advanced analytics.
- UniSupport: Offers comprehensive support and detailed analytics but has a complex UI.
- TechAssist: User-friendly interface but limited in terms of data visualization capabilities.

## Requirement Analysis

The application needs to handle user authentication (though not implemented), ticket management, and data visualization through microservices.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement a login page for both simple users and helpdesk staff']
- ['P1', 'Develop a ticket management system with CRUD operations for tickets']
- ['P2', 'Create a database to store tickets and user interactions']
- ['P3', 'Design microservices for data visualization and analysis']
- ['P4', 'Implement message exchange functionality between users and helpdesk staff']

## UI Design draft

The application will have a clean, modern design with clear navigation. The main dashboard will display open tickets, recent activities, and user messages. Helpdesk staff will have access to advanced analytics through a separate section.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Are there any specific technologies or frameworks that should be used for the microservices architecture?
