## Original Requirements

Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.

## Requirements:

### Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

### Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

### Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

## Product Goals

- Provide an intuitive ticket lifecycle management interface for both users and helpdesk staff.
- Enable real‑time communication and status tracking within each ticket.
- Deliver actionable analytics via dedicated micro‑services to support resource planning.

## User Stories

- As a student, I want to submit a new ticket so I can report a broken elevator.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to change a ticket status from open to active so I can start working on it.
- As a user, I want to view my open tickets and add comments so I can track progress.
- As a helpdesk staff, I want to see analytics of ticket volume over time to allocate resources efficiently.

## Requirement Analysis

The system must support role‑based ticket visibility and status transitions without a full authentication layer. A lightweight GUI (Tkinter or PyQt) will be used for the front‑end, while a SQLite or PostgreSQL database will persist tickets, messages, and timestamps. CRUD operations for tickets and messages must be exposed via a REST API so that micro‑services can query data. Three micro‑services will perform analytics: (1) count open tickets in a user‑selected period, (2) compute average resolution time per month, and (3) cluster active tickets by category. All services should be containerized (Docker) and communicate over HTTP/JSON. The design must allow easy addition of new categories or status values in the future.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Ticket CRUD and status transitions (open → active → closed).']
- ['P0', 'Role‑based ticket visibility (simple user vs helpdesk).']
- ['P0', 'Per‑ticket messaging system with timestamps.']
- ['P1', 'Persistent storage of tickets, messages, and metadata.']
- ['P1', 'Micro‑service API layer for analytics.']

## UI Design draft

Login page: two radio buttons (Helpdesk / User) and a "Continue" button. Ticket list view: table with columns (ID, Title, Category, Status, Last Modified). For users, only open/active rows are selectable; for helpdesk, all rows are selectable. Ticket detail panel: description, status dropdown (enabled only for helpdesk), message thread with timestamped entries, and a text box to add a new message. Analytics dashboard (accessible only to helpdesk): three tabs – 1) Period selector with a chart of open tickets, 2) Monthly resolution time bar chart, 3) Category pie chart of active tickets. Simple, clean layout with consistent color scheme (blue accents).

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specification does not define authentication; role selection is manual. It also does not specify the persistence engine (SQLite vs PostgreSQL) or deployment environment (local vs cloud). Clarification on these points would help finalize the architecture.
