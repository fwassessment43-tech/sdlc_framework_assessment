    "Implementation approach": We will utilize a Python-based framework such as Flask or Django to create the ticket management web application. This choice is based on its ease of use, flexibility, and scalability. Additionally, we will leverage the built-in support for responsive design in our chosen framework to ensure an engaging user experience.
