## Implementation approach

We will use Flask as our web framework to create a RESTful API that can be easily integrated with third-party services like Google Cloud Vision API or Amazon Rekognition.

## File list

- app.py
- templates/index.html

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class Image {
        -id: int
        -filename: str
        -filepath: str
        +upload(image_file: FileStorage)
        +get_predictions() list
    }
    class Prediction {
        -id: int
        -image_id: int
        -label: str
        -confidence: float
        +__init__(image_id: int, label: str, confidence: float)
    }
    Image --> Prediction


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Server
    participant I as Image
    participant P as Prediction
    C->>S: POST /images (image_file)
    S->>I: upload(image_file)
    I-->>S: return image_id
    S->>P: get_predictions()
    P-->>S: return predictions
    S-->>C: return predictions


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on third-party API integration, ...
