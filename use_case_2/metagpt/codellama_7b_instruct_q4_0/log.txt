The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

Third-party API integration: The code requires a JSON key file to be present in the project directory to authenticate with the Google Cloud Vision API or Amazon Rekognition. However, this file should not be committed to version control and instead should be stored securely outside of the project directory.\n2. Error handling: The code does not handle errors gracefully when uploading images or receiving predictions from the third-party APIs. It is important to provide clear error messages and handle exceptions appropriately to ensure that the application remains stable and reliable.\n3. Testing: The code could benefit from more unit tests to ensure that it works correctly and handles edge cases.\n4. Documentation: The code could be further documented with docstrings for each function, class, and method to make it easier for others to understand and contribute to the project.\n5. Code organization: The code is organized into separate files for the Flask app, templates, and data structures. However, it would be beneficial to organize the code into smaller, more focused modules that can be easily imported and reused in other projects.\n6. Version control: The code should be committed to a version control system such as Git to track changes and collaborate with others.\n7. Deployment: The code could be deployed on a cloud platform such as Google App Engine or Amazon Web Services to make it accessible to users over the internet.\n8. Security: The code does not have any security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security threats. It is important to implement appropriate security measures, such as authentication and authorization, to ensure that the application remains secure.\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock.

You have been asked to review the following files:\n\n* `app.py`\n\nYour task is to provide a detailed analysis of the code, highlighting any issues or areas for improvement. You should also provide specific recommendations for how to fix these issues.\n\nHere are some potential issues that you may find in the code:\n\n1. The code does not follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python, which can make it harder for others to read and understand.\n2. The `Image` class is not well-documented, which can make it difficult for others to understand how to use it correctly.\n3. The `get_predictions` method in the `Image` class does not handle errors properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the Google Cloud Vision API returns an error.\n4. The code does not include any unit tests or integration tests, which can make it difficult to ensure that the code works correctly and is stable over time.\n5. The code does not have a clear separation of concerns between the front-end and back-end, which can make it difficult to maintain and update the code.\n\nHere are some potential recommendations for how to fix these issues:\n\n1. To improve the readability of the code, you could consider using a linter tool such as `pylint` or `flake8` to check for style guide violations and automatically fix them. You could also consider adding type hints to the code to make it easier to understand what each variable is used for.\n2. To improve the documentation of the code, you could consider adding more docstrings to the classes and methods in the `Image` class to explain how they should be used correctly. You could also consider adding a README file that explains how to use the application and provides examples of how to use it.\n3. To handle errors properly, you could consider using try-except blocks around the code that calls the Google Cloud Vision API to catch any errors that may occur and provide more informative error messages to the user. You could also consider adding a logging mechanism to track any errors that occur and provide more detailed information about what went wrong.\n4. To improve the testing of the code, you could consider adding unit tests or integration tests to ensure that the code works correctly and is stable over time. You could also consider using a testing framework such as `pytest` to make it easier to write and run tests.\n5. To improve the separation of concerns between the front-end and back-end, you could consider moving the logic for handling user input and making API calls to the back-end code, while keeping the front-end code focused on rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. You could also consider using a framework such as `Flask` or `Django` to make it easier to build and deploy the web application.\n\nOverall, your goal should be to provide clear and actionable feedback that will help the developer improve the quality of the code and make it more maintainable and scalable over time.\n\n# Instruction: rewrite code based on the Code Review and Actions\n## Rewrite Code: CodeBlock. If it still has some bugs, rewrite app.py with triple quotes. Do your utmost to optimize THIS SINGLE FILE. Return all completed codes and prohibit the return of unfinished codes.\n```Code\n## app.py\n...\n```\n'}]
