## Original Requirements

Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

## Product Goals

- Ensure an intuitive user interface for both simple users and helpdesk staff
- Implement robust data handling and analysis capabilities for helpdesk staff
- Provide a secure and efficient ticket management system

## User Stories

- As a simple user, I want to be able to report issues on the application.
- As a simple user, I want to view all open and active tickets related to my reported issue.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to view all open, active, and closed tickets.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and vice versa.
- As a simple user or helpdesk staff member, I want to exchange messages related to each ticket.
- As an admin, I want to visualize data for analysis purposes.

## Competitive Analysis

- Ticket Management System A: Basic functionality with limited analytics
- HelpDeskPro: User-friendly interface and advanced analytics features
- CampusConnect: Responsive design and integration with mobile devices
- TicketMaster: Comprehensive ticket management system but lacks user interaction features
- UniversityHelpdesk: Simple and easy to use, but lacks data analysis capabilities

## Requirement Analysis

The ticket management application will be designed to handle multiple user types and provide a seamless experience for both simple users and helpdesk staff. The system will include features such as reporting issues, viewing open tickets, exchanging messages, changing ticket statuses, and data visualization for analysis purposes.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement basic functionalities including login page, ticket management system, and microservices architecture']
- ['P1', 'Design a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation for both simple users and helpdesk staff']
- ['P2', 'Develop the database to store tickets and user interaction data efficiently']
- ['P3', 'Create APIs for the microservices to interact with the database']
- ['P4', 'Implement services 1, 2, and 3 as specified in the requirements']

## UI Design draft

The UI will be designed with a clean and modern look. It will include distinct sections for simple users (e.g., 'Report Issue', 'View Tickets') and helpdesk staff (e.g., 'Manage Tickets', 'Data Analysis'). The design should support both desktop and mobile devices.
