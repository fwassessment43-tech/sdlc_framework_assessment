This choice is made because Django provides robust tools for building secure, scalable web applications quickly. For the frontend, we\'ll use React.js to create an intuitive and responsive user interface. We\'ll also utilize PostgreSQL as our database due to its reliability and support for complex queries needed for data analysis. The application will follow a microservices architecture where different components (like ticket management, authentication, and analytics) can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled.","File
