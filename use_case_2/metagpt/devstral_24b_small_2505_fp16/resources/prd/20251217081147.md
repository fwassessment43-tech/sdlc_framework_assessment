## Original Requirements

Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue. The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

## Project Name

university_ticket_management

## Product Goals

- Create an intuitive user interface for reporting and managing tickets
- Implement robust backend services for ticket management and analysis
- Ensure secure and efficient database interactions

## User Stories

- As a student, I want to report issues on campus so that they can be addressed by the helpdesk.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to view all tickets including open, active, and closed ones so that I can manage them effectively.
- As a user, I want to receive updates on my reported issues through messages associated with each ticket.
- As a helpdesk manager, I want to analyze ticket data to identify trends and improve campus services.
- As an admin, I want to ensure the system is secure and all interactions are logged properly.

## Competitive Analysis

- ServiceNow: Comprehensive IT service management but complex for simple use cases
- Zendesk: User-friendly interface with good ticketing features but may lack specific campus-related functionalities
- Freshdesk: Good automation features but might be overkill for a university-specific application
- Jira Service Management: Powerful but requires extensive configuration and training
- Help Scout: Excellent customer support features but not tailored to campus management

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires a robust backend to handle ticket management and user interactions. The frontend should be intuitive for both students and helpdesk staff. Microservices architecture will enable scalable data visualization and analysis.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement the core ticketing system with CRUD operations']
- ['P0', 'Design an intuitive GUI for users to report and manage tickets']
- ['P1', 'Develop microservices for data visualization and analysis']
- ['P1', 'Ensure secure database interactions and data storage']
- ['P2', 'Implement user authentication and authorization']

## UI Design draft

The UI will consist of a login page, ticket management dashboard with views for open, active, and closed tickets. Each ticket will have a description field, status indicator, category selector, and message thread for communication.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on specific security requirements and any existing infrastructure that should be integrated.
