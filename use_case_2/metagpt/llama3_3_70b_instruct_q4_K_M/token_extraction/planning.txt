\n## context\n\n### Project Name\n\n\n### Original Requirements\nCreate a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.\n\nThe application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.\n\nUse python programming language.\n# Requirements:\n\n## Login page:\n    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.\n    - Do not implement any login and user management system.\n\n## Ticket management system:\n    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:\n        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the \'open\' and \'active\' tickets.\n        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from \'open\' to \'active\' and from \'active\' to \'closed\'.\n        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.\n    - Ticket attributes:\n        - Each ticket has a status assigned:\n            - A newly created ticket has the status \'open\' assigned by default.\n            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from \'open\' to \'active\' and from \'active\' to \'closed\'.\n        - Each ticket has a free text description field.\n        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen\'s food complaints)\n        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.\n    - Database:\n        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.\n        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.\n\n## Micro-services architecture:\n    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.\n    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.\n    - Implement the following services:\n        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.\n        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)\n        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.\n\n### Search Information\n-\n\n\n-----\n\n## format example\n[CONTENT]\n{\n    "Language": "en_us",\n    "Programming Language": "Python",\n    "Original Requirements": "Create a 2048 game",\n    "Project Name": "game_2048",\n    "Product Goals": [\n        "Create an engaging user experience",\n        "Improve accessibility, be responsive",\n        "More beautiful UI"\n    ],\n    "User Stories": [\n        "As a player, I want to be able to choose difficulty levels",\n        "As a player, I want to see my score after each game",\n        "As a player, I want to get restart button when I lose",\n        "As a player, I want to see beautiful UI that make me feel good",\n        "As a player, I want to play game via mobile phone"\n    ],\n    "Competitive Analysis": [\n        "2048 Game A: Simple interface, lacks responsive features",\n        "play2048.co: Beautiful and responsive UI with my best score shown",\n        "2048game.com: Responsive UI with my best score shown, but many ads"\n    ],\n    "Competitive Quadrant Chart": "quadrantChart\\n    title \\"Reach and engagement of campaigns\\"\\n    x-axis \\"Low Reach\\" --> \\"High Reach\\"\\n    y-axis \\"Low Engagement\\" --> \\"High Engagement\\"\\n    quadrant-1 \\"We should expand\\"\\n    quadrant-2 \\"Need to promote\\"\\n    quadrant-3 \\"Re-evaluate\\"\\n    quadrant-4 \\"May be improved\\"\\n    \\"Campaign A\\": [0.3, 0.6]\\n    \\"Campaign B\\": [0.45, 0.23]\\n    \\"Campaign C\\": [0.57, 0.69]\\n    \\"Campaign D\\": [0.78, 0.34]\\n    \\"Campaign E\\": [0.40, 0.34]\\n    \\"Campaign F\\": [0.35, 0.78]\\n    \\"Our Target Product\\": [0.5, 0.6]",\n    "Requirement Analysis": "",\n    "Requirement Pool": [\n        [\n            "P0",\n            "The main code ..."\n        ],\n        [\n            "P0",\n            "The game algorithm ..."\n        ]\n    ],\n    "UI Design draft": "Basic function description with a simple style and layout.",\n    "Anything UNCLEAR": ""\n}\n[/CONTENT]\n\n## nodes: "<node>: <type>  # <instruction>"\n- Language: <class \'str\'>  # Provide the language used in the project, typically matching the user\'s requirement language.\n- Programming Language: <class \'str\'>  # Python/JavaScript or other mainstream programming language.\n- Original Requirements: <class \'str\'>  # Place the original user\'s requirements here.\n- Project Name: <class \'str\'>  # According to the content of "Original Requirements," name the project using snake case style , like \'game_2048\' or \'simple_crm.\n- Product Goals: typing.List[str]  # Provide up to three clear, orthogonal product goals.\n- User Stories: typing.List[str]  # Provide up to 3 to 5 scenario-based user stories.\n- Competitive Analysis: typing.List[str]  # Provide 5 to 7 competitive products.\n- Competitive Quadrant Chart: <class \'str\'>  # Use mermaid quadrantChart syntax.
