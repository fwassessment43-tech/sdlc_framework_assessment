The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

The system should be scalable and maintainable.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Implement the core ticket management functionality (submission, viewing, modification, status tracking)."],["P0","Implement the database schema and API for data storage and retrieval."],["P1","Implement the microservices for data analysis (ticket trends, resolution times)."],["P1","Develop the GUI for both simple users and helpdesk staff."],["P2","Implement user authentication and authorization (although not initially required)."]],"UI Design draft":"The UI will be web-based with a clean and intuitive design. The main page will display a list of tickets with filtering and sorting options. Each ticket will have a detailed view with all relevant information and a messaging section. The helpdesk staff interface will have additional features for managing tickets and accessing data analysis tools. The color scheme will be consistent and visually appealing.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specific database technology is not specified.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn).

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.
