## Original Requirements

Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue. The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform. Requirements:

Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

## Product Goals

- Provide a user-friendly interface for ticket reporting and management.
- Enable efficient ticket resolution through clear workflows and data visualization.
- Offer a scalable and maintainable microservices architecture.

## User Stories

- As a student, I want to be able to easily submit a ticket for a broken elevator so that the issue can be addressed quickly.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to be able to view all open tickets and prioritize them based on urgency.
- As a helpdesk manager, I want to be able to see the average ticket resolution time to identify areas for improvement.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to be able to quickly change the status of a ticket (open, active, closed) to reflect its progress.
- As a helpdesk staff member, I want to be able to add messages to a ticket to communicate with the user and other staff.

## Competitive Analysis

- Jira Service Management: Powerful but complex, geared towards larger organizations.
- Zendesk: Comprehensive customer service platform, can be overkill for a university campus.
- Freshdesk: User-friendly and affordable, but may lack advanced features.
- Help Scout: Focuses on email-based support, less suitable for diverse issue types.
- ServiceNow: Enterprise-level solution, too expensive and complex for this project.
- RT (Request Tracker): Open-source ticketing system, requires significant setup and maintenance.
- OTRS: Another open-source option, similar to RT in terms of complexity.

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires a web application with a GUI for ticket management, a database for data storage, and a microservices architecture for data analysis. Key features include ticket submission, status tracking, messaging, and data visualization. The application should cater to both students (simple users) and helpdesk staff. The microservices should provide insights into ticket trends and resolution times. The system should be scalable and maintainable.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement the core ticket management functionality (submission, viewing, modification, status tracking).']
- ['P0', 'Implement the database schema and API for data storage and retrieval.']
- ['P1', 'Implement the microservices for data analysis (ticket trends, resolution times).']
- ['P1', 'Develop the GUI for both simple users and helpdesk staff.']
- ['P2', 'Implement user authentication and authorization (although not initially required).']

## UI Design draft

The UI will be web-based with a clean and intuitive design. The main page will display a list of tickets with filtering and sorting options. Each ticket will have a detailed view with all relevant information and a messaging section. The helpdesk staff interface will have additional features for managing tickets and accessing data analysis tools. The color scheme will be consistent and visually appealing.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific database technology is not specified. The level of detail required for the data analysis tools is also unclear. The exact API specifications for the microservices need to be defined. The requirements do not specify any reporting features beyond the three microservices.
