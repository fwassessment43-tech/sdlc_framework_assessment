Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

\n# System\nRole: You are a professional software engineer, and your main task is to review and revise the code. You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.  The UI will follow a component-based architecture for reusability and maintainability.","File list":["main.py","frontend/src/App.js","frontend/src/components/TicketList.js","frontend/src/components/TicketDetail.js","ticket_service/app.py","ticket_service/models.py","ticket_service/api.py","analytics_service/app.py","analytics_service/analytics.py","database/init_db.py","docker-compose.yml","requirements.txt"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\\nclassDiagram\\n    class Main {\\n        -TicketService ticket_service\\n        -AnalyticsService analytics_service\\n        +main() str\\n    }\\n    class TicketService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +create_ticket(ticket_data: dict) int\\n        +get_ticket(ticket_id: int) dict\\n        +update_ticket(ticket_id: int, ticket_data: dict) bool\\n        +get_all_tickets(status: str) list\\n        +change_ticket_status(ticket_id: int, status: str) bool\\n        +add_message(ticket_id: int, message: str) bool\\n    }\\n    class AnalyticsService {\\n        -Database database\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_period(period: str) int\\n        +get_average_resolution_time_by_month() dict\\n        +get_ticket_counts_by_category() dict\\n    }\\n    class Database {\\n        -connection\\n        +connect()\\n        +execute_query(query: str) list\\n        +insert_data(table: str, data: dict) int\\n        +update_data(table: str, condition: str, data: dict) bool\\n    }\\n    class Ticket {\\n        -ticket_id: int\\n        -description: str\\n        -status: str\\n        -category: str\\n        -opening_date: datetime\\n        -last_modification_date: datetime\\n        -closing_date: datetime\\n    }\\n    Main --> TicketService\\n    Main --> AnalyticsService\\n    TicketService --> Database\\n    AnalyticsService --> Database\\n    TicketService --* Ticket\\n","Program call flow":"\\nsequenceDiagram\\n    participant M as Main\\n    participant TS as TicketService\\n    participant AS as AnalyticsService\\n    participant DB as Database\\n    participant UI as UserInterface\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to create a ticket\\n    M->>TS: create_ticket(ticket_data)\\n    TS->>DB: insert_data(tickets, ticket_data)\\n    DB-->>TS: return ticket_id\\n    TS-->>M: return ticket_id\\n    M-->>UI: return ticket_id\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request to get all open tickets\\n    M->>TS: get_all_tickets(status=\'open\')\\n    TS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE status=\'open\')\\n    DB-->>TS: return list of tickets\\n    TS-->>M: return list of tickets\\n    M-->>UI: return list of tickets\\n\\n    UI->>M: Request analytics data (ticket counts by period)\\n    M->>AS: get_ticket_counts_by_period(period)\\n    AS->>DB: execute_query(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets WHERE opening_date BETWEEN ...

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

You need to ensure that the code conforms to the google-style standards, is elegantly designed and modularized, easy to read and maintain.\nLanguage: Please use the same language as the user requirement, but the title and code should be still in English. For example, if the user speaks Chinese, the specific text of your answer should also be in Chinese.\nATTENTION: Use \'##\' to SPLIT SECTIONS, not \'#\'. Output format carefully referenced "Format example".\n\n# Context\n## System Design\n{"Implementation approach":"This project will be implemented using a microservices architecture with Python and Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL as the database. Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

The UI design draft is high-level and detailed mockups would be beneficial. The security aspects (authentication, authorization) are not fully defined. Error handling strategies for the APIs need to be specified.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

The UI design draft is high-level and detailed mockups would be beneficial. The security aspects (authentication, authorization) are not fully defined. Error handling strategies for the APIs need to be specified.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

The UI design draft is high-level and detailed mockups would be beneficial. The security aspects (authentication, authorization) are not fully defined. Error handling strategies for the APIs need to be specified.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

The UI design draft is high-level and detailed mockups would be beneficial. The security aspects (authentication, authorization) are not fully defined. Error handling strategies for the APIs need to be specified.

Flask will be used to create REST APIs for each microservice. React will provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. PostgreSQL will ensure data persistence and scalability. We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

We will leverage existing Python libraries for database interaction (SQLAlchemy), API development (Flask-RESTful), and data analysis (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Docker will be used for containerization and deployment. The microservices will communicate via REST APIs.  We\'ll prioritize a modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.

The UI design draft is high-level and detailed mockups would be beneficial. The security aspects (authentication, authorization) are not fully defined. Error handling strategies for the APIs need to be specified.
