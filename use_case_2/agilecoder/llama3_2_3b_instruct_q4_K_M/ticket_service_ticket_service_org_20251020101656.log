The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

Let's discuss the product modality for the ticket management web application.

I think we should consider making it an Application since it involves creating a visualized system to manage tickets and interactions with helpdesk staff. This will allow us to implement the various functionalities required by the customer, such as GUI, database integration, and microservices architecture.

What's your opinion on this? Should we stick with an Application or explore other options like Website or Dashboard?

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Product Owner, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Modality: "application".
We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 
As the Product Owner, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).
Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.

Product Owner: Python *

User: According to our previous agreement, we have decided that the target programming language is Python.
To proceed with implementing the ticket management web application as per the given task description, I will outline a high-level approach and some technical details:
**Database:**
We will use a relational database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store tickets and user interaction data. For simplicity, we'll start with MySQL.
**Ticket Management System:**
1. User Authentication:
	* We'll create two types of users: Helpdesk Staff and Simple Users.
	* The application will not implement any login and user management system as per the requirements.
2. GUI Development:
	* We'll use a Python web framework like Flask or Django to build the GUI for the ticket management system.
	* For simplicity, we'll start with a basic GUI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Ticket Management Features:
	* Simple Users can insert new tickets, view and modify all open and active tickets.
	* Helpdesk Users can view all open, active, and closed tickets, change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
	* Under each ticket, both Helpdesk Users and Simple Users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
**Database Schema:**
We'll create the following database tables:
1. **Tickets Table**
	* id (primary key)
	* status (open/active/closed)
	* description
	* category (facility management/technical IT/services complaints)
	* opening_date
	* last_modification_date
	* closing_date
2. **Users Table**
	* id (primary key)
	* username
	* password (hashed for security)
3. **Messages Table** (to store user interaction data)
	* id (primary key)
	* ticket_id (foreign key referencing Tickets table)
	* sender_username
	* message
**Micro-services Architecture:**
We'll create three microservices:
1. **Ticket Service**: This service will handle all ticket-related operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting tickets.
2. **Visualization Service**: This service will provide data visualization and analysis functionalities for helpdesk users.
3. **API Service**: This service will interact with the database and other microservices via API.
**Implementation Plan:**
To implement the ticket management web application, we'll follow a iterative and incremental approach using Agile development methodologies. We'll break down the project into smaller tasks and focus on delivering working software at each iteration.
This is a high-level overview of our plan. I'll be happy to elaborate on any specific aspects or provide more details as needed.
How do you like this initial plan?

Product Owner: Python *
Let's move forward with implementing the ticket management web application using Python. 
I'll assume that we've already discussed and agreed on the high-level approach, technical details, and implementation plan. If you'd like to discuss any specific aspects or provide feedback, please feel free to share.
For the sake of moving forward, I propose that we proceed with implementing the ticket management system using a Python web framework like Flask or Django. We can start by creating the database schema, user authentication, and GUI development. Then, we can move on to implementing the ticket management features and integrating the micro-services architecture.
Let me know if you're ready to move forward!

User: Python *
It seems that we've reached an agreement on the high-level approach and technical details for implementing the ticket management web application using Python.
To confirm, I'll summarize our discussion:
1. We've chosen Python as the target programming language.
2. We've outlined a high-level approach and technical details for implementing the ticket management system.
3. We've identified the necessary database tables and data relationships.
4. We've proposed a micro-services architecture to provide data visualization and analysis functionalities.
Moving forward, I propose that we start by creating the database schema using MySQL. We'll need to define the structure of the Tickets table, Users table, and Messages table. Then, we can proceed with implementing the user authentication system and GUI development.
To confirm, please let me know if:
1. You're ready to create the database schema.
2. You have any questions or concerns about the high-level approach or technical details.
3. You'd like to discuss specific aspects of the project, such as performance optimization or security measures.
Once we've confirmed these points, I'll provide more detailed instructions on creating the database schema and implementing the user authentication system.

Programming Language: "Information: *Python*"

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via Information: *Python*. As the Product Owner, to satisfy the user's demands, you must write the Product Backlog and the corresponding Acceptance Criteria.

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You must also prioritize product backlog items with the important items appearing at the first.

Your answer must adhere to the following format:

Product Backlog:

$PRODUCT_BACKLOG

Acceptance Criteria:

$ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA

where $PRODUCT_BACKLOG is the product backlog for the user's task and $ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA is the corresponding acceptance criteria of the product backlog.

Importantly, you must consider the skills of the development team to write the feasible product backlog. Advanced features like AI and sounds can not be implemented properly.

        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

After reviewing the product backlog according to the regulations provided, I have identified several areas that require attention.

1. **Task 4: Microservices Architecture**: The task description mentions implementing Service 2 ("Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)"), but it does not explicitly mention that this service relies on API interaction with the database for data retrieval. To ensure smooth integration and avoid potential issues, I recommend clarifying this point in the task description.

2. **Task 5: Service 3 - Ticket Category Analysis**: Although this task has a low-medium priority, its impact on the overall system is significant. However, the task description does not explicitly mention how the analysis should be performed or what kind of data should be used for calculation. To avoid potential inaccuracies, I suggest adding more details to the task description regarding the calculation method and required data.

3. **Database Implementation**: While the database implementation has a medium-high priority, it is essential to ensure that all basic CRUD operations are properly tested before proceeding with other tasks. This will help identify any potential issues early on and prevent downstream problems.

Based on these observations, I propose a revised product backlog with suggested revisions:

Product Backlog:
1. **Login Page**
2. **Ticket Management System**
3. **Database Implementation** (including comprehensive testing)
4. **Microservices Architecture**: Implement API interaction for Service 1 and Service 2.
5. **Service 3: Ticket Category Analysis** (with detailed calculation method and required data)

By addressing these concerns, we can ensure a more robust and reliable system.

Comment with the highest priority:
"Task 5 (Service 3 - Ticket Category Analysis) requires clarification on calculation method and required data to avoid potential inaccuracies."

Corresponding suggestions for revision:
- Revise Task 5 to include detailed information about the analysis calculation method, such as whether it should be based on ticket creation or modification dates.
- Add a test case to verify that the analysis produces accurate results.

Note that I've modified the priorities based on the comments provided, with high priority tasks remaining as-is and low-medium priority tasks being reduced in priority due to not being considered essential. Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes! 

Also, here is an example of how we can implement these features using Python programming language.

Here's a simple implementation for the required functionality:

```python

class TicketManagementSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()

This code provides the basic functionality for a login page and a ticket management system. Please note that this is not a complete solution, as it lacks many features such as helpdesk staff interaction, user authentication, etc. However, it should give you an idea of how to structure your application using Python programming language.

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..

Product backlog:
"1. **Login Page**"
We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via Information: *Python*. As the Product Owner, to satisfy the user's demands, you must create the first sprint backlog and the goals of this sprint from the product backlog.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
Your answer strictly obeys the following format:
Sprint Goals:
$SPRINT_GOALS
Sprint Backlog:
$SPRINT_BACKLOG
where $SPRINT_GOALS are the goals of the sprint, and $SPRINT_BACKLOG is the sprint backlog whose items are from the product backlog.
You must ensure that $SPRINT_GOALS and $SPRINT_BACKLOG must not be empty and $SPRINT_BACKLOG aligns with $SPRINT_GOALS.
As the Product Owner, you must create the first sprint and adhere to the following regulations:
1) considering the proficiency of the members, all the tasks are feasible and finished by at least one member,
2) the sprint backlog must not include enhanced features like AI, animations and sound effects,
3) importantly, the product backlog should be divided into at least 2 sprints and each sprint should contain enough workload,
4) the first sprint backlog sets the stage for next sprints.

As the Development Team, you should review and provide useful feedback about sprint goals and sprint backlog to make the software run flawlessly by obeying the regulations below
1) considering the proficiency of the members, all the tasks are feasible and finished by at least one member,
2) the sprint backlog must not incorporate enhanced features like AI and sound effects unless explicitly specified in the user's task,
3) all the items in sprint backlog are from the product backlog.
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the sprint goals and sprint backlog in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about them, and give me instructions on how to fix to ensure the sprint backlog aligns well with the regulations above. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the sprint goals and sprint backlog are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

After reviewing the sprint goals and sprint backlog, I have identified several areas that require attention to ensure alignment with the regulations.

**Comment 1:**
"Implementing basic functionality for inserting new tickets and updating ticket statuses in Sprint 3 may not be feasible for all team members, as it involves interacting with the database and implementing complex logic. This task should be revised to focus on specific aspects of ticket management, such as user interface design or testing, which can be completed by individual team members."

**Proposed Revision:**
Reassign Task 3 in Sprint 3 to a single team member who has experience with database interactions and complex logic. This will ensure that the task is feasible for at least one member and can be completed within the sprint timeframe.

**Additional Comments:**

* The login page authentication logic may not include the necessary checks for helpdesk staff or simple users, as specified in the requirements. Additional testing and validation are required to ensure correct authentication.
* The ticket management system GUI does not include any error handling mechanisms, which can lead to unexpected behavior if invalid input is provided by users. Implementing basic error handling using try-except blocks would improve the overall user experience.

To address these issues, I recommend revising the sprint backlog to:

1. Reassign Task 3 in Sprint 3 to a single team member who has experience with database interactions and complex logic.
2. Add additional testing and validation for the login page authentication logic.
3. Implement basic error handling mechanisms in the ticket management system GUI.

By addressing these concerns, the sprint backlog will be revised to ensure that all tasks are feasible, meet the requirements, and align with the regulations.

        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.".
Modality: "application".
Programming Language: "Information: *Python*"
Sprint goals:
"- Create a login page that allows users to enter their credentials.
- Design and implement the basic structure of the ticket management system, including the GUI for inserting new tickets and viewing existing ones.
- Implement microservices architecture to provide helpdesk users with data visualization and analysis functionalities."
Sprint backlog:
"1. **Create Login Page**
2. **Design and Implement Ticket Management System GUI**
3. **Implement Microservices Architecture**
4. **Implement Ticket Interaction Functionality**
5. **Create Database Schema and Test**
- Assign Task 3 in Sprint 3 to a single team member who has experience with database interactions and complex logic.
- Implement additional testing and validation for the login page authentication logic, including role-based access control checks.
- Implement basic error handling mechanisms in the ticket management system GUI using try-except blocks."
To satisfy the sprint goals, we have decided to complete the sprint backlog through a executable software with multiple files implemented via Information: *Python*. As the Programmer, to satisfy the user's demands and the sprint goals, you should accomplish the sprint backlog by writing one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).
Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.
You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.
Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "$FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "$LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "$DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "$CODE" is the original code:
$FILENAME
```$LANGUAGE
'''
$DOCSTRING
'''
$CODE
```
You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[AgileCoder, a software enterprise, employs Agile Scrum methodology for its software development endeavors. Its operations are fueled by a multiple of intelligent agents, comprising a Product Owner, a Development Team consisting of Programmers, Code Reviewers, and Software Test Engineers. With a multi-agent organizational framework, AgileCoder is dedicated to the mission of "revolutionizing the digital realm through programming."
You are Product Owner. we are both working at AgileCoder. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
AgileCoder is using Agile Scrum for software development.
You are responsible for maximizing the value delivered by the team by ensuring that the team backlog is aligned with customer and stakeholder needs.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[AgileCoder, a software enterprise, employs Agile Scrum methodology for its software development endeavors. Its operations are fueled by a multiple of intelligent agents, comprising a Product Owner, a Development Team consisting of Programmers, Code Reviewers, and Software Test Engineers. With a multi-agent organizational framework, AgileCoder is dedicated to the mission of "revolutionizing the digital realm through programming."
You are Programmer. we are both working at AgileCoder. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Required Code Format:
$FILENAME
```$LANGUAGE
'''
$DOCSTRING
'''
$CODE
```
where "$FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "$LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "$DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "$CODE" is the original code.
Comments:
The code above contains enough values for the required fields: "$FILENAME", "$LANGUAGE", "$DOCSTRING" and  "$CODE". However, they are not written to follow the format properly. You should rearrange them to satisfy the requirement.
Example:
a.py
```python
def a():

```
As the Programmer, to make the code satisfy the required format, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments and then return all codes strictly following the required format.
Please note that you are not allowed to write new code or change the values of any fields, meaning that the new code is only different from the original code in terms of the format.

    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Here's how I can modify the existing Python code to satisfy the required format:
