
[You are a client. You employ AgileCoder, a software development company, to develop a product based on the following task description: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
You also require AgileCoder to obey the following requirements:
1. The proposed features can be implementable,
2. The product successfully runs without any errors,
3. The product is be designed for ease of use,
4. The product has a full of manual and relevant documentation.
To achieve your goal, you must write a response based on your needs.]
