
[You are a client. You employ AgileCoder, a software development company, to develop a product based on the following task description: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
You also require AgileCoder to obey the following requirements:
1. The proposed features can be implementable,
2. The product successfully runs without any errors,
3. The product is be designed for ease of use,
4. The product has a full of manual and relevant documentation.

### Product Backlog:

1. **User Interface (GUI) for Ticket Management**
   - Develop a GUI that supports simple users (non-helpdesk staff) and helpdesk staff for entering, viewing, modifying, and managing tickets.
   - Ensure the GUI is user-friendly and intuitive for both types of users.

2. **Ticket Database Implementation**
   - Design and implement a database schema to store ticket details such as status, category, description, opening/last modification/closing date, etc.
   - Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

3. **Microservices Architecture for Data Visualization and Analysis**
   - Develop microservices that provide data visualization and analysis functionalities to helpdesk staff.
   - These services should include:
     1. Displaying the number of tickets opened in a selected period (last X hours/days).
     2. Calculating and displaying average ticket resolution time by opening month.
     3. Clustering tickets by category and displaying the number of active tickets per category.

4. **Microservices API for Database Interaction**
   - Implement an API that microservices can use to interact with the database.
   - Ensure secure data access is maintained through the API.

### Acceptance Criteria:

1. **User Interface (GUI) for Ticket Management:**

   1.1. Simple User:
      - A simple user should be able to navigate and manage their tickets effectively.
      - Simple users can insert a new ticket with a free text description and view all open/active tickets.

   2. Helpdesk Users:
      - Helpdesk staff can view, modify, and add new tickets.
      - They can change the status of tickets from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
      - Helpdesk users can exchange messages with simple users on a per-ticket basis.

   3. Ticket Database Implementation:

      1. Basic CRUD Operations:
         - Create, read, update, and delete operations for ticket records.
         - Ensure that the database schema supports the required attributes such as status, category, description, opening/last modification/closing date.

   4. Microservices Architecture for Data Visualization and Analysis:

      1. Service 1: Number of Tickets Opened in a Selected Period:
         - The microservice should allow selection of period (X hours/days).
         - It should return the count of tickets that have been opened but not yet closed within the specified time frame.

      2. Service 2: Average Ticket Resolution Time by Opening Month:
         - Calculate and display the average resolution time for each ticket, grouped by their opening month.
         - This should be displayed in a readable format (e.g., days/weeks/months).

      3. Service 3: Clustering Tickets by Category and Displaying Active Tickets:
         - Cluster tickets based on their category (facility management, technical IT, services complaints).
         - Provide the count of active tickets per category.

   5. Microservices API for Database Interaction:

      - Securely interact with the database via an API.
      - Ensure that API endpoints are properly documented and authenticated to protect data integrity.

By prioritizing these items in order, we can ensure a smooth transition from initial setup to more advanced functionalities such as microservice-based analytics and data visualization. This approach allows for iterative development and ensures functional progress throughout the project lifecycle.
