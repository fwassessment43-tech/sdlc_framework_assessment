**task_prompt**: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.

Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.

As the Product Owner, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?

Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

4. The product has a full of manual and relevant documentation.
To achieve your goal, you must write a response based on your needs.]

Given the requirements of the new customer's task, I think the most suitable product modality would be an Application, as it involves creating a ticket management web application with interactive features and a microservices architecture. 

However, considering AgileCoder's previous products and the need for data visualization and analysis functionalities, a Dashboard could also be a viable option, as it can display real-time information and provide interactive visualizations.

But since the customer specifically asks for a "ticket management web application", I lean more towards an Application. 

What are your thoughts on this?

[2025-23-10 11:40:33 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 I agree with your assessment that an Application is the most suitable product modality for this task, given the requirements of creating a ticket management web application with interactive features and a microservices architecture.

The customer's request for a "ticket management web application" strongly suggests that an Application is the desired outcome. Additionally, the requirements for user interaction, ticket management, and data visualization are all well-suited to an Application.

While a Dashboard could be a viable option for displaying real-time information and providing interactive visualizations, it may not fully meet the customer's requirements for a comprehensive ticket management system with features like user authentication, ticket creation, modification, and assignment of status.

An Application, on the other hand, can provide a more holistic solution that integrates all these features and provides a seamless user experience.

Considering AgileCoder's expertise in developing Applications, I believe we are well-equipped to deliver a high-quality product that meets the customer's needs.

Modality: "application".

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. 

As the Product Owner, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language. If python can complete this task via Python, please answer Python; otherwise, answer another programming language (e.g., Java, C++, etc,).

Note that we must ONLY discuss the target programming language and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion and conclude the best programming language we have discussed without any other words or reasons, return only one line using the format: "<INFO> *" where "*" represents a programming language.
