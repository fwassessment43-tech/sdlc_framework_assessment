Its operations are fueled by a multiple of intelligent agents, comprising a Product Owner, a Development Team consisting of Programmers, Code Reviewers, and Software Test Engineers. With a multi-agent organizational framework, AgileCoder is dedicated to the mission of "revolutionizing the digital realm through programming."
You are Programmer. we are both working at AgileCoder. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]


Based on the provided requirements and task, it appears that AgileCoder's software development process is structured around creating a ticket management web application for university campuses. The software is designed to allow users to report issues, view and modify open and active tickets, and interact with helpdesk staff who are responsible for addressing the issue.

To ensure that the software meets the requirements and sprint goals set by AgileCoder, I would propose the following comments and suggestions:

1. Comments should be added to all methods to provide a clear understanding of their purpose and expected inputs/outputs. This will make it easier for developers to understand the code and maintain it over time.
2. The database connection and querying methods should be thoroughly tested to ensure that they are working correctly and returning the expected results.
3. The microservices architecture should be implemented in a way that allows for easy integration with the ticket management application and provides helpful data visualization and analysis functionalities for helpdesk users.
4. The login page should be designed to provide a user-friendly interface for both simple users and helpdesk staff, allowing them to easily access the ticket management system.
5. Ensure that all tasks are completed before moving on to the next sprint, including any necessary testing or debugging.
6. To make the software directly operable without further coding, ensure that all referenced classes are imported and all methods are implemented. Also, ensure that the used assets like images must exist and be referred properly.
7. Ensure that the colors used are easy on the eye and provide a clear visual indication of different types of data or information displayed in the software.
8. Prohibit code from being put in a try-exception in the main.py, as this can cause unnecessary complexity and difficulty in debugging.
9. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement.

Overall, it is important to ensure that all aspects of the software are thoroughly tested and reviewed before moving on to the next sprint to ensure that the final product meets the requirements and user needs. Additionally, it is crucial to maintain a clear and organized code structure, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code over time.

Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer here, to make the software directly operable without further coding, AgileCoder has formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) To satisfy the sprint goals, the code implements all the tasks in the sprint backlog;
7) Make sure the used assets like images must exist and be referred properly
8) Ensure that the colors used are easy on the eye
9) prohibitively put code in a try-exception in the main.py
10) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".
Please help me by giving a detailed answer that is tailored to my situation and requirements here.

Its operations are fueled by a multiple of intelligent agents, comprising a Product Owner, a Development Team consisting of Programmers, Code Reviewers, and Software Test Engineers. With a multi-agent organizational framework, AgileCoder is dedicated to the mission of "revolutionizing the digital realm through programming."
You are Programmer. we are both working at AgileCoder. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]


"AgileCoder, as a Code Reviewer, I would review the provided code based on the regulations mentioned above. Here is my first priority comment and corresponding suggestion for fixing:

1. All referenced classes should be imported - Priority: High
Suggestion: Please import all the necessary Python modules and packages in the beginning of the file to ensure that all the methods are properly executed."

Also, I would like to suggest some additional regulations to improve the code's quality and readability.

1. Use meaningful variable names - Priority: High
Suggestion: Please use descriptive variable names instead of using generic names like "data" or "user_id". This will make the code easier to understand and maintain."
2. Avoid unnecessary comments - Priority: Medium
Suggestion: Please remove all unnecessary comments from the code as they do not provide any value to the reader. Instead, use docstrings to document the functions and classes."
3. Use consistent formatting - Priority: High
Suggestion: Please use consistent formatting throughout the code. This will make it easier for readers to understand the structure of the code and identify any potential errors."
4. Avoid duplicated code - Priority: High
Suggestion: Please avoid duplicating code by using functions or classes that can perform similar tasks. This will reduce the maintenance effort and improve the overall quality of the code."

    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.."
Modality: "powerpoint and excel".
Programming Language: "Python"
Sprint goals:
"1. Implement Service 4: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
2. Ensure that all tasks are completed before moving on to the next sprint."
Sprint backlog:
"1. Revise tasks 10a and 10b into separate tasks with clear and concise descriptions
2. Update the product backlog to reflect the changes in tasks 10a and 10b
3. Ensure that all team members understand the revised task descriptions and are aware of the resource requirements for each task
4. Implement Service 4: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days)
5. Ensure that all tasks are completed before moving on to the next sprint"
