
[You are a client. You employ AgileCoder, a software development company, to develop a product based on the following task description: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
You also require AgileCoder to obey the following requirements:
1. The proposed features can be implementable,
2. The product successfully runs without any errors,
3. The product is be designed for ease of use,
4. The product has a full of manual and relevant documentation.
To achieve your goal, you must write a response based on your needs.]

I think the product should be an Application, as it requires a GUI and interactive features to manage tickets and provide data visualization and analysis functionalities.

However, it could also be a Website, but considering the requirements of having a login page, ticket management system, and micro-services architecture, I believe an Application would be more suitable.

It's also possible to consider a Dashboard, but since the product requires a range of features beyond just displaying real-time information, I think Application or Website might be a better fit.

What are your thoughts on this? Should we consider any other modalities or do you agree with my assessment?

Prioritization:
The product backlog items are prioritized based on their importance and complexity, with the most critical features (Login Page, Ticket Management System, Database Implementation) appearing first, followed by ticket attributes, microservices architecture, and finally the specific services. This order ensures that the core functionality of the application is developed before adding more advanced features.

**Comment with Highest Priority:**
The product backlog seems mostly aligned with the user's requirements but lacks specificity in terms of database implementation and microservices architecture. The highest priority concern is the lack of detail regarding how the database will be implemented (e.g., using relational databases like MySQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB) and how the microservices will interact via API.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
1. **Specify Database Implementation:** Clearly define which type of database will be used (relational, NoSQL, graph database) and why it's chosen for this application. For example, "3. **Database Implementation**: Develop a relational database using MySQL to store tickets and user interaction data, including basic functionalities like inserting and modifying data."
2. **Detail Microservices Architecture:** Provide more details on how the microservices architecture will be implemented. This includes specifying the framework or tools that will be used for creating the API (e.g., Flask, Django REST framework) and how each service will interact with the database and the ticket management application.

**Example Revision:**
- For **Database Implementation**: "3. **Database Implementation**: Use MySQL for developing a relational database to store tickets and user interaction data."
- For **Microservices Architecture**: "5. **Microservices Architecture**: Design a microservices architecture using Flask for creating RESTful APIs, enabling interaction between services and the ticket management application. Specify how each service (Service 1, Service 2, Service 3) will be implemented to provide their respective functionalities."

By addressing these points, the product backlog can be more comprehensive and better aligned with the project's technical requirements, ensuring a smoother development process.

Here's the updated and comprehensive product backlog, addressing the comments and suggestions for revision:

1. **Login Page**: Create a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as helpdesk staff or a simple user without implementing any login and user management system.
2. **Ticket Management System**: Design a GUI for ticket management, enabling simple users to insert new tickets, view, and modify 'open' and 'active' tickets, while helpdesk users can view all tickets, change status, and exchange messages.
3. **Database Implementation**: Develop a relational database using MySQL to store tickets and user interaction data, including basic functionalities like inserting and modifying data. The choice of MySQL is based on its reliability, ease of use, and compatibility with Python.
4. **Ticket Attributes**: Implement ticket attributes such as status (open, active, closed), description field, automatically assigned category (facility management, technical IT, services complaints), and date attributes (opening, last modification, closing).
5. **Microservices Architecture**: Design a microservices architecture using Flask for creating RESTful APIs, enabling interaction between services and the ticket management application. The API will be used for services to interact with the database and each other. Each service will have its own endpoint:
   - Service 1: `/tickets/open` to display open tickets.
   - Service 2: `/resolution/time` to calculate average resolution time.
   - Service 3: `/categories/active` to cluster active tickets by category.
6. **Service 1: Open Tickets Analysis**: Implement a service that allows users to choose a period and displays the number of tickets opened in that period, which have not yet been closed. This will be achieved through a query to the database using the chosen period as a parameter.
7. **Service 2: Average Resolution Time**: Develop a service that calculates and displays the average ticket resolution time by the opening month of the ticket. The calculation will involve querying the database for tickets resolved in each month and then computing the average resolution time.
8. **Service 3: Ticket Category Clustering**: Implement a service that clusters tickets by category and displays the number of active tickets per category. This will be done through a SQL query that groups tickets by their category and filters for only those that are active.

By following this updated product backlog, we aim to develop a comprehensive ticket management system with robust database integration and microservices architecture, meeting all the requirements specified in the user's task.
