        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:

  As the Product Owner, I would like you to create a detailed design document that includes all the necessary components, screenshots, wireframes, and mockups for the ticket management web application. The design document should also include information on how the web application will interact with the database and the microservices architecture.

Once you have completed the design document, I would like you to create a minimum viable product (MVP) of the web application that includes all the essential components described in the design document. The MVP should be deployed on a testing environment, and it should be ready for us to test and evaluate.

Finally, as the Product Owner, I would like you to create a user manual or guide that explains how to use the web application. This manual should include information on how to navigate the application, how to create, view, and modify tickets, and how to perform complex analysis on the data related to tickets.

Please provide me with more information regarding the database schema, microservices architecture, and prioritization of features. I am excited about this project, and I believe we can create a ticket management web application that meets our users' needs and exceeds their expectations. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and I will do my best to address them.
