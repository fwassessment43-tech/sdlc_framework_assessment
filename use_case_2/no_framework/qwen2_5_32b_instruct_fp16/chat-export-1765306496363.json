We'll be implementing this with Flask for our backend services, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Bootstrap for front-end styling.\n\nHere is an outline of how you can implement the requirements:\n\n### Step 1: Setup Environment\n\nFirst, make sure you have Python installed. Then install necessary packages:\n```bash\npip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_wtf sqlalchemy\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define Database Models (models.py)\n\nWe will define two models - `User` and `Ticket`. Since user management is not required, we'll only focus on the ticket model.\n\n```python\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\n\nclass Ticket(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    description = db.Column(db.String(500), nullable=False)\n    category = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)  # 'facility', 'technical IT', 'services'\n    status = db.Column(db.String(20), default='open')  # 'open', 'active', 'closed'\n    opening_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default=db.func.now())\n    last_modification_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, onupdate=db.func.now(), nullable=True)\n    closing_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f'<Ticket {self.id}>'\n```\n\n### Step 3: Flask Application Setup (app.py)\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for\nfrom models import db, Ticket\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///tickets.db' # Use SQLite for simplicity\ndb.init_app(app)\nwith app.app_context():\n    db.create_all()\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\n@app.route('/login')\ndef login_page():\n    return render_template('login.html')  # Placeholder template\n\n@app.route('/tickets', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef tickets():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        description = request.form.get('description')\n        category = request.form.get('category')\n        new_ticket = Ticket(description=description, category=category)\n        db.session.add(new_ticket)\n        db.session.commit()\n        return redirect(url_for('tickets'))\n    \n    # GET request\n    tickets_query = Ticket.query.all()  # Adjust query based on user role.\n    return render_template('tickets.html', tickets=tickets_query)\n\n# Implement other routes for ticket modification, status change, etc.\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Frontend (HTML Templates)\n\nYou need to create HTML templates for login and ticket management. Here's a simple example of what `tickets.html` might look like:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<title>Tickets</title>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='css/bootstrap.min.css') }}\">\n</head>\n<body>\n<div class=\"container mt-5\">\n    <h2>New Ticket Submission</h2>\n    <form method=\"post\">\n        <div class=\"mb-3\">\n            <label for=\"description\">Description:</label>\n            <textarea class=\"form-control\" id=\"description\" name=\"description\"></textarea>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mb-3\">\n            <label for=\"category\">Category</label>\n            <select class=\"form-select\" id=\"category\" name=\"category\">\n                <option value=\"facility\">Facility Management</option>\n                <option value=\"technical IT\">Technical IT Issues</option>\n                <option value=\"services\">Services Complaints</option>\n            </select>\n        </div>\n        <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Submit Ticket</button>\n    </form>\n\n    <!-- Display existing tickets here -->\n</div>\n<script src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='js/bootstrap.min.js') }}\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Step 5: Microservices\n\nFor microservices, you can use Flask blueprints or separate Flask applications. Define APIs for each service and interact with the database through these endpoints.\n\nExample of a simple API endpoint:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Blueprint, jsonify\n\nanalysis_bp = Blueprint('analysis', __name__)\n\n@analysis_bp.route('/ticket_stats/<int:days>', methods=['GET'])\ndef ticket_stats(days):\n    # Implement logic to retrieve tickets opened in last X days.\n    return jsonify({\"tickets\": []})  # Dummy data for demonstration\n```\n\nIntegrate this into the main Flask app by registering the blueprint.\n\n### Step 6: Run Application\n\nMake sure your database is set up correctly and run the application:\n\n```bash\npython app.py\n```\n\nNavigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.\n\nThis setup provides a basic structure for implementing ticket management functionalities. You would need to expand this with proper authentication, detailed error handling, more sophisticated templating, and security measures like CSRF protection.","model":"qwen2.5:32b-instruct-fp16","modelName":"qwen2.5:32b-instruct-fp16","modelIdx":0,"timestamp":1765306001,"lastSentence":"This setup provides a basic structure for implementing ticket management functionalities.","usage":{"response_token/s":3,"prompt_token/s":126.05,"total_duration":387565988090,"load_duration":25942457509,"prompt_eval_count":545,"prompt_tokens":545,"prompt_eval_duration":4323640079,"eval_count":1069,"completion_tokens":1069,"eval_duration":356790799072,"approximate_total":"0h6m27s","total_tokens":1614,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"done":true,"followUps":["How can I implement user roles in the application without a full login system?","Can you provide an example of how to cluster tickets by category using Flask and SQLAlchemy?","What additional steps should be taken to ensure data security in this ticket management web app?","How do we integrate Bootstrap into our project for styling, as mentioned in the outline?","Could you explain more about setting up and running microservices with Flask blueprints?"]}},"currentId":"f1c5940e-8bb1-44c0-98d2-cc8566c17546"},"messages":[{"id":"1d7d87a5-de61-4e95-9111-391e5e1facec","parentId":null,"childrenIds":["f1c5940e-8bb1-44c0-98d2-cc8566c17546"],"role":"user","content":"Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints).
