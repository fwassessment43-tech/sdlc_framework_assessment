To begin resolving this task, I will first need to understand the overall structure and organization of the codebase. Specifically, I'll need to locate where the ticket management system is implemented, as well as any existing database interactions or microservices that are already in place. Once I have a clear picture of the current setup, I can start assigning tasks to my interns.

Intern Name: Codebase Navigator
Subgoal: Locate all files and directories related to the ticket management system, database interactions, and microservices. Provide an overview of their structure and contents.

The repository currently does not contain any code for the ticket management system, database interactions, or microservices. Therefore, we need to start by creating a new application from scratch.

Intern Name: Codebase Editor
Subgoal: Create a basic structure for a Python-based web application using Flask. Include directories for templates, static files, and app logic. Additionally, set up an initial route for the login page and a simple database connection.

The basic structure of the Flask application is set up successfully. Now, let's initialize a simple Flask app in `app.py`, create a route for the login page, and set up an initial database connection using SQLAlchemy.
