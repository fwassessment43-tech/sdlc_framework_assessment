Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category.

2025-10-20 15:38:53,679 - HyperAgent.LoggingIOConsole - INFO: To develop this ticket management web application, we'll break it down into smaller tasks and implement each component using Python programming language.

**Step 1: Login Page**

We'll use a simple GUI library like Tkinter to create the login page. We won't implement any user management system for now.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

class LoginPage:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Login Page")

        self.username_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Username")
        self.username_label.pack()

        self.username_entry = tk.Entry(self.root)
        self.username_entry.pack()

        self.password_label = tk.Label(self.root, text="Password")
        self.password_label.pack()

        self.password_entry = tk.Entry(self.root, show="*")
        self.password_entry.pack()

        self.login_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Login", command=self.login)
        self.login_button.pack()

    def login(self):
        # TO DO: Implement authentication logic
        username = self.username_entry.get()
        password = self.password_entry.get()
        if username == "admin" and password == "password":
            print("Login successful")
            # Create a new instance of TicketManagementApp
            self.root.destroy()
            TicketManagementApp()
        else:
            messagebox.showerror("Invalid credentials", "Please try again")

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    login_page = LoginPage()
    login_page.run()
```

**Step 2: Ticket Management System**

We'll create a GUI using Tkinter to manage tickets. Simple users can insert new tickets and view/modify existing ones, while helpdesk users can change ticket status and exchange messages.

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

class TicketManagementApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Ticket Management App")

        # Create a frame for the main menu
        self.main_menu_frame = tk.Frame(self.root)
        self.main_menu_frame.pack()

        # Create buttons for simple users and helpdesk users
        self.simple_user_button = tk.Button(self.main_menu_frame, text="Simple User", command=self.simple_user_menu)
        self.simple_user_button.pack(side=tk.LEFT)

        self.helpdesk_user_button = tk.Button(self.main_menu_frame, text="Helpdesk User", command=self.helpdesk_user_menu)
        self.helpdesk_user_button.pack(side=tk.LEFT)

    def simple_user_menu(self):
        # Create a new instance of SimpleUserMenu
        self.simple_user_menu_instance = SimpleUserMenu()
        self.simple_user_menu_instance.run()

    def helpdesk_user_menu(self):
        # Create a new instance of HelpdeskUserMenu
        self.helpdesk_user_menu_instance = HelpdeskUserMenu()
        self.helpdesk_user_menu_instance.run()

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()

class SimpleUserMenu:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Simple User Menu")

        # Create a frame for the ticket list
        self.ticket_list_frame = tk.Frame(self.root)
        self.ticket_list_frame.pack()

        # Create a button to insert new tickets
        self.insert_ticket_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Insert New Ticket", command=self.insert_new_ticket)
        self.insert_ticket_button.pack()

    def insert_new_ticket(self):
        # Insert a new ticket into the database
        # TO DO: Implement insertion logic

        # Create a new window to display the inserted ticket
        self.new_ticket_window = tk.Toplevel(self.root)
        self.new_ticket_window.title("New Ticket")

        # Display the inserted ticket in the new window
        # TO DO: Implement display logic

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()

class HelpdeskUserMenu:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = tk.Tk()
        self.root.title("Helpdesk User Menu")

        # Create a frame for the ticket list
        self.ticket_list_frame = tk.Frame(self.root)
        self.ticket_list_frame.pack()

        # Create buttons to view and modify tickets
        self.view_ticket_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="View Tickets", command=self.view_tickets)
        self.view_ticket_button.pack()

        self.modify_ticket_button = tk.Button(self.root, text="Modify Ticket", command=self.modify_ticket)
        self.modify_ticket_button.pack()

    def view_tickets(self):
        # View all open and active tickets
        # TO DO: Implement view logic

    def modify_ticket(self):
        # Modify an existing ticket
        # TO DO: Implement modification logic

    def run(self):
        self.root.mainloop()
```

**Step 3: Micro-Services Architecture**

We'll create a micro-services architecture using Flask to provide data visualization and analysis functionalities.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pandas as pd

app = Flask(__name__)

# Create a database to store ticket data
tickets_db = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, 3],
    "status": ["open", "active", "closed"],
    "description": ["Ticket 1", "Ticket 2", "Ticket 3"]
})

@app.route("/get_tickets", methods=["GET"])
def get_tickets():
    # Get the number of open tickets in the last X hours
    x_hours = int(request.args.get("x_hours"))
    open_tickets = tickets_db[tickets_db["status"] == "open"][tickets_db["created_at"].dt.date - pd.Timestamp.now().date()] <= x_hours
    return jsonify({"count": len(open_tickets)})


@app.route("/get_average_resolution_time", methods=["GET"])
def get_average_resolution_time():
    # Get the average resolution time by month
    monthlyResolutionTime = tickets_db[tickets_db["status"] == "closed"].groupby(tickets_db["created_at"].dt.month)["resolution_time"].mean()
    return jsonify({"average": monthlyResolutionTime.mean()})


@app.route("/get_tickets_by_category", methods=["GET"])
def get_tickets_by_category():
    # Get the number of active tickets per category
    categories = tickets_db[tickets_db["status"] == "active"]["category"].unique()
    active_tickets_per_category = [len(tickets_db[(tickets_db["status"] == "active") & (tickets_db["category"] == category)]) for category in categories]
    return jsonify({"categories": [{"category": category, "count": count} for category, count in zip(categories, active_tickets_per_category)]})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This is a basic implementation of the ticket management system and micro-services architecture. There are many improvements that can be made to make it more robust and efficient.

**Step 4: Database**

We'll create a database using SQLite to store all the data.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("tickets.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table for tickets
cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tickets (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        status TEXT NOT NULL,
        description TEXT NOT NULL,
        created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    );
""")

# Insert some sample data
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO tickets (status, description) VALUES (?, ?)", ("open", "Ticket 1"))
conn.commit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    conn.close()
```

This is a basic implementation of the database. There are many improvements that can be made to make it more robust and efficient.

I hope this helps you in creating your ticket management system! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
