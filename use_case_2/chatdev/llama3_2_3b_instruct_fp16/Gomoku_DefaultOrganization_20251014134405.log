        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.

I'm excited to discuss this with you.

To answer your questions:

1. The type of information I'll be presenting is a combination of educational content and business data. As a conversational AI, my primary goal is to provide users with accurate and informative responses to their queries, covering various topics such as technology, science, history, culture, and more.
2. The primary purpose of the product (my AI system) is for education and information sharing. My creators aim to use me as a knowledge-sharing tool, providing users with helpful and engaging content that can aid in learning, exploration, and discovery.

As we continue our discussion, I'd love to explore how these purposes align with your goals and what topics you're interested in exploring further!

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..

I'd be happy to explain decorators and generators in Python.

### Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. They can also accept arguments which allows them to customize their behavior.

Here is an example of how you might use a decorator:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

In this example, `my_decorator` is a function that takes another function (`func`) as an argument. It then returns a new function, `wrapper`, which calls the original function and adds some extra behavior before and after it's called.

When you see `@my_decorator` above a function definition (like `@my_decorator def say_hello()`), it is equivalent to writing:

```python
def say_hello():
    pass

say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)
```

So, the output will be:
```
Something is happening before the function is called.
Hello!
Something is happening after the function is called.
```

### Decorators with Arguments

Decorators can also accept arguments. Here's an example of a decorator that logs the time it takes to execute:

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def sleep_for_seconds(seconds):
    import time
    time.sleep(seconds)

sleep_for_seconds(1)
```

In this example, the `timer_decorator` logs how long it takes to execute a function. The `wraps` decorator is used to preserve the metadata (name, docstring, etc.) of the original function.

### Decorators with Default Arguments

Decorators can also accept default arguments. Here's an example of a decorator that checks if you're calling it in debug mode:

```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if True:  # replace True with environment variables or other conditions
            print(f"DEBUG: {func.__name__} was called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@debug_decorator
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

### Generators

Generators are special functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

Here's an example of how you might use a generator:

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Usage:
for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` generator produces values based on the Fibonacci sequence. Each time you call `next(fibonacci())`, it returns the next number in the sequence.

Generators can also be used as arguments to functions:

```python
def sum_numbers(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
result = sum_numbers((x for x in numbers))
print(result)  # prints: 15
```

In this example, we create a generator that yields the elements of `numbers` one at a time. We then pass this generator to the `sum_numbers` function.

### Generators with yield from

Generators can also use the `yield from` syntax to delegate to other generators:

```python
def flatten(generators):
    for g in generators:
        yield from g

gen1 = (1, 2)
gen2 = ('a', 'b')

flat_gen = flatten((gen1, gen2))
for num in flat_gen:
    print(num)  # prints: 1, 2, a, b
```

In this example, the `flatten` generator takes multiple generators as arguments and yields all of their elements.

Generators can also be used to generate tuples:

```python
def tuple_generator(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return result

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
```

In this example, the `tuple_generator` generator returns a list of numbers. We can convert this to a tuple by calling `tuple()`.

Generators have several benefits over lists and other sequences:

*   **Memory Efficiency**: Generators use significantly less memory than lists because they only store the current value instead of all values in advance.
*   **Lazy Evaluation**: Because generators evaluate values on demand, they can be more efficient for large datasets that don't need to be accessed all at once.

        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:

7.  **Break up long paragraphs**: Divide long paragraphs into shorter ones to improve readability.

Here's an updated version of your content with these suggestions applied:

### Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. They can also accept arguments which allows them to customize their behavior.

```python
# Example 1: Basic decorator
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # prints: Hello! Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called.
```

### Decorators with Arguments

Decorators can also accept arguments. Here's an example of a decorator that logs the time it takes to execute:

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

# Example 2: Decorator with argument
def timer_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def sleep_for_seconds(seconds):
    import time
    time.sleep(seconds)

sleep_for_seconds(1)  # prints: Time taken: 1.00 seconds
```

### Decorators with Default Arguments

Decorators can also accept default arguments. Here's an example of a decorator that checks if you're calling it in debug mode:

```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if DEBUG_MODE:  # replace DEBUG_MODE with environment variables or other conditions
            print(f"DEBUG: {func.__name__} was called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@debug_decorator
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)  # prints nothing if not in debug mode
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

### Generators

Generators are special functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

```python
# Example 1: Basic generator
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)  # prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

### Generators with `yield from`

Generators can also use the `yield from` syntax to delegate to other generators:

```python
# Example 2: Generator with yield from
def flatten(generators):
    for g in generators:
        yield from g

gen1 = (1, 2)
gen2 = ('a', 'b')

flat_gen = flatten((gen1, gen2))
for num in flat_gen:
    print(num)  # prints: 1, 2, a, b
```

### Generators with `tuple` and `list`

Generators can also be used to generate tuples:

```python
# Example 3: Generator that generates tuples
def tuple_generator(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return result

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

# Generators can also be used to generate lists:
def list_generator(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return result

numbers = list(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Here are the suggested improvements with some additional explanations:

### Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. They can also accept arguments which allows them to customize their behavior.

#### Basic Decorator Example
```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # prints: Hello! Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` takes a function as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`) that "wraps" the original function. The `@my_decorator` syntax above the `say_hello()` function definition is just syntactic sugar for doing `say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)`.

#### Decorator with Argument Example
```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def sleep_for_seconds(seconds):
    import time
    time.sleep(seconds)

sleep_for_seconds(1)  # prints: Time taken: 1.00 seconds
```

In this example, the `timer_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function calls the original function with its arguments and also measures the time it took to execute.

#### Decorator with Default Argument Example
```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if DEBUG_MODE:  # replace DEBUG_MODE with environment variables or other conditions
            print(f"DEBUG: {func.__name__} was called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@debug_decorator
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)  # prints nothing if not in debug mode
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

In this example, the `debug_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function checks if it's in "debug mode" before calling the original function.

### Generators

Generators are special functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

#### Basic Generator Example
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)  # prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function generates the first n Fibonacci numbers using a generator.

#### Generator with `yield from`
```python
def flatten(generators):
    for g in generators:
        yield from g

gen1 = (1, 2)
gen2 = ('a', 'b')

flat_gen = flatten((gen1, gen2))
for num in flat_gen:
    print(num)  # prints: 1, 2, a, b
```

In this example, the `flatten` function uses the `yield from` syntax to delegate to other generators.

#### Generator with `tuple` and `list`
```python
def tuple_generator(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

def list_generator(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return list(result)

numbers = list(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

In this example, the `tuple_generator` function generates a tuple of numbers and the `list_generator` function generates a list of numbers.

Decorators
================

### Introduction to Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. They can also accept arguments which allows them to customize their behavior.

### Basic Decorator Example

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    """
    A basic decorator that prints before and after calling a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function.
    """

    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")

    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    """
    Prints a greeting message.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # prints: Hello! Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` takes a function as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`) that "wraps" the original function. The `@my_decorator` syntax above the `say_hello()` function definition is just syntactic sugar for doing `say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)`.

### Decorator with Argument Example

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function and measures its execution time.
    """

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result

    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def sleep_for_seconds(seconds):
    """
    Sleeps for a specified number of seconds.
    
    Args:
        seconds: The number of seconds to sleep.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    import time
    time.sleep(seconds)

sleep_for_seconds(1)  # prints: Time taken: 1.00 seconds
```

In this example, the `timer_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function calls the original function with its arguments and also measures the time it took to execute.

### Decorator with Default Argument Example

```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that prints debug information if in debug mode.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function and prints debug information if in debug mode.
    """

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if DEBUG_MODE:  # replace DEBUG_MODE with environment variables or other conditions
            print(f"DEBUG: {func.__name__} was called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

@debug_decorator
def add(a, b):
    """
    Returns the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number.
    
    Returns:
        The sum of a and b.
    """

    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)  # prints nothing if not in debug mode
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

In this example, the `debug_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function checks if it's in "debug mode" before calling the original function.

Generators
================

### Introduction to Generators

Generators are special functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

### Basic Generator Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    A generator that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
    
    Yields:
        The next Fibonacci number.
    """

    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)  # prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function generates the first n Fibonacci numbers using a generator.

### Generator with `yield from`

```python
def flatten(generators):
    """
    A generator that flattens a list of generators into a single generator.
    
    Args:
        generators: A list of generators to be flattened.
    
    Yields:
        The next value from each generator.
    """

    for g in generators:
        yield from g

gen1 = (1, 2)
gen2 = ('a', 'b')

flat_gen = flatten((gen1, gen2))
for num in flat_gen:
    print(num)  # prints: 1, 2, a, b
```

In this example, the `flatten` function uses the `yield from` syntax to delegate to other generators.

### Generator with `tuple` and `list`

```python
def tuple_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a tuple of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the tuple.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

def list_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the list.
    
    Returns:
        A list of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return list(result)

numbers = list(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

In this example, the `tuple_generator` function generates a tuple of numbers and the `list_generator` function generates a list of numbers.

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:

Decorators
================

### Introduction to Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. They can also accept arguments which allows them to customize their behavior.

### Basic Decorator Example

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    """
    A basic decorator that prints before and after calling a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function.
    """

    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")

    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    """
    Prints a greeting message.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # prints: Hello! Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` takes a function as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`) that "wraps" the original function. The `@my_decorator` syntax above the `say_hello()` function definition is just syntactic sugar for doing `say_hello = my_decorator(say_hello)`.

### Decorator with Argument Example

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function and measures its execution time.
    """

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result

    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def sleep_for_seconds(seconds):
    """
    Sleeps for a specified number of seconds.
    
    Args:
        seconds: The number of seconds to sleep.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    import time
    time.sleep(seconds)

sleep_for_seconds(1)  # prints: Time taken: 1.00 seconds
```

In this example, the `timer_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function calls the original function with its arguments and also measures the time it took to execute.

### Decorator with Default Argument Example

```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that prints debug information if in debug mode.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function and prints debug information if in debug mode.
    """

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if DEBUG_MODE:  # replace DEBUG_MODE with environment variables or other conditions
            print(f"DEBUG: {func.__name__} was called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

@debug_decorator
def add(a, b):
    """
    Returns the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number.
    
    Returns:
        The sum of a and b.
    """

    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)  # prints nothing if not in debug mode
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

In this example, the `debug_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function checks if it's in "debug mode" before calling the original function.

Generators
================

### Introduction to Generators

Generators are special functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

### Basic Generator Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    A generator that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
    
    Yields:
        The next Fibonacci number.
    """

    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)  # prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function generates the first n Fibonacci numbers using a generator.

### Generator with `yield from`

```python
def flatten(generators):
    """
    A generator that flattens a list of generators into a single generator.
    
    Args:
        generators: A list of generators to be flattened.
    
    Yields:
        The next value from each generator.
    """

    for g in generators:
        yield from g

gen1 = (1, 2)
gen2 = ('a', 'b')

flat_gen = flatten((gen1, gen2))
for num in flat_gen:
    print(num)  # prints: 1, 2, a, b
```

In this example, the `flatten` function uses the `yield from` syntax to delegate to other generators.

### Generator with `tuple` and `list`

```python
def tuple_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a tuple of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the tuple.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

def list_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the list.
    
    Returns:
        A list of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return list(result)

numbers = list(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

In this example, the `tuple_generator` function generates a tuple of numbers and the `list_generator` function generates a list of numbers.

    """

    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")

    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    """
    Prints a greeting message.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # prints: Hello! Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` takes a function as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`) that "wraps" the original function.

### Decorator with Argument Example

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:

    """

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result

    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def sleep_for_seconds(seconds):
    """
    Sleeps for a specified number of seconds.
    
    Args:
        seconds: The number of seconds to sleep.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    import time
    time.sleep(seconds)

sleep_for_seconds(1)  # prints: Time taken: 1.00 seconds
```

In this example, the `timer_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function calls the original function with its arguments and also measures the time it took to execute.

### Decorator with Default Argument Example

```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that prints debug information if in debug mode.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.

        The sum of a and b.
    """

    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)  # prints nothing if not in debug mode
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

In this example, the `debug_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function checks if it's in "debug mode" before calling the original function.

Generators
================

### Introduction to Generators

Generators are special functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

### Basic Generator Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    A generator that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
    
    Yields:
        The next Fibonacci number.
    """

    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)  # prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function generates the first n Fibonacci numbers using a generator.

### Generator with `yield from`

```python
def flatten(generators):
    """
    A generator that flattens a list of generators into a single generator.
    
    Args:
        generators: A list of generators to be flattened.
    
    Yields:
        The next value from each generator.
    """

    for g in generators:
        yield from g

gen1 = (1, 2)
gen2 = ('a', 'b')

flat_gen = flatten((gen1, gen2))
for num in flat_gen:
    print(num)  # prints: 1, 2, a, b
```

In this example, the `flatten` function uses the `yield from` syntax to delegate to other generators.

### Generator with `tuple` and `list`

```python
def tuple_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a tuple of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the tuple.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

def list_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the list.
    
    Returns:
        A list of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):

You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.

Decorators
================

### Introduction to Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. They can also accept arguments which allows them to customize their behavior.

### Basic Decorator Example

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    """
    A basic decorator that prints before and after calling a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function.
    """

    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")

    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    """
    Prints a greeting message.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # prints: Hello! Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called.
```

In this example, `my_decorator` takes a function as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`) that "wraps" the original function.

### Decorator with Argument Example

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function and measures its execution time.
    """

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result

    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def sleep_for_seconds(seconds):
    """
    Sleeps for a specified number of seconds.
    
    Args:
        seconds: The number of seconds to sleep.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    import time
    time.sleep(seconds)

sleep_for_seconds(1)  # prints: Time taken: 1.00 seconds
```

In this example, the `timer_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function calls the original function with its arguments and also measures the time it took to execute.

### Decorator with Default Argument Example

```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that prints debug information if in debug mode.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function and prints debug information if in debug mode.
    """

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if DEBUG_MODE:  # replace DEBUG_MODE with environment variables or other conditions
            print(f"DEBUG: {func.__name__} was called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

@debug_decorator
def add(a, b):
    """
    Returns the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number.
    
    Returns:
        The sum of a and b.
    """

    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)  # prints nothing if not in debug mode
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

In this example, the `debug_decorator` takes a function (`func`) as an argument and returns a new function (`wrapper`). The `wrapper` function checks if it's in "debug mode" before calling the original function.

Generators
================

### Introduction to Generators

Generators are special functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

### Basic Generator Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    A generator that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
    
    Yields:
        The next Fibonacci number.
    """

    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)  # prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function generates the first n Fibonacci numbers using a generator.

### Generator with `yield from`

```python
def flatten(generators):
    """
    A generator that flattens a list of generators into a single generator.
    
    Args:
        generators: A list of generators to be flattened.
    
    Yields:
        The next value from each generator.
    """

    for g in generators:
        yield from g

gen1 = (1, 2)
gen2 = ('a', 'b')

flat_gen = flatten((gen1, gen2))
for num in flat_gen:
    print(num)  # prints: 1, 2, a, b
```

In this example, the `flatten` function uses the `yield from` syntax to delegate to other generators.

### Generator with `tuple` and `list`

```python
def tuple_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a tuple of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the tuple.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

def list_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the list.
    
    Returns:
        A list of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return list(result)

numbers = list(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

# Generators
================

### Introduction to Generators

Generators are special functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list, for example.

### Basic Generator Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    A generator that generates the first n Fibonacci numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
    
    Yields:
        The next Fibonacci number.
    """

    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)  # prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
```

### Generator with `yield from`

```python
def flatten(generators):
    """
    A generator that flattens a list of generators into a single generator.
    
    Args:
        generators: A list of generators to be flattened.
    
    Yields:
        The next value from each generator.
    """

    for g in generators:
        yield from g

gen1 = (1, 2)
gen2 = ('a', 'b')

flat_gen = flatten((gen1, gen2))
for num in flat_gen:
    print(num)  # prints: 1, 2, a, b
```

### Generator with `tuple` and `list`

```python
def tuple_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a tuple of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the tuple.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

def list_generator(n):
    """
    A generator that generates a list of numbers.
    
    Args:
        n: The number of values in the list.
    
    Returns:
        A list of numbers.
    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return list(result)

numbers = list(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Generator with `next` Function

```python
def infinite_sequence():
    """
    A generator that generates an infinite sequence of numbers.
    
    Yields:
        The next number in the sequence.
    """

    i = 0
    while True:
        yield i
        i += 1

seq = infinite_sequence()
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(seq))  # prints: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

You are Chief Executive Officer. Now, we are both working at ChatDev and we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:

# Decorators
================

### Introduction to Decorators

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. They can also accept arguments which allows them to customize their behavior.

### Basic Decorator Example

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    """
    A basic decorator that prints before and after calling a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function.
    """

    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")

    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    """
    Prints a greeting message.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # prints: Hello! Something is happening before the function is called. Something is happening after the function is called.
```

### Decorator with Argument Example

```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def timer_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function and measures its execution time.
    """

    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"Time taken: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
        return result

    return wrapper

@timer_decorator
def sleep_for_seconds(seconds):
    """
    Sleeps for a specified number of seconds.
    
    Args:
        seconds: The number of seconds to sleep.
    
    Returns:
        None
    """

    import time
    time.sleep(seconds)

sleep_for_seconds(1)  # prints: Time taken: 1.00 seconds
```

### Decorator with Default Argument Example

```python
def debug_decorator(func):
    """
    A decorator that prints debug information if in debug mode.
    
    Args:
        func: The function to be decorated.
    
    Returns:
        A new function that wraps the original function and prints debug information if in debug mode.
    """

    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        if DEBUG_MODE:  # replace DEBUG_MODE with environment variables or other conditions
            print(f"DEBUG: {func.__name__} was called with args: {args}, kwargs: {kwargs}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)

    return wrapper

@debug_decorator
def add(a, b):
    """
    Returns the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
        a: The first number.
        b: The second number.
    
    Returns:
        The sum of a and b.
    """

    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)  # prints nothing if not in debug mode
print(result)  # prints: 3
```

    Args:
        n: The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
    
    Yields:
        The next Fibonacci number.
    """

    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

for i, num in enumerate(fibonacci(10)):
    print(num)  # prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers

    """

    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(i)
    return tuple(result)

numbers = tuple(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

def list_generator(n):
    """

numbers = list(tuple_generator(10))
print(numbers)  # prints: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Generator with `next` Function

```python
def infinite_sequence():
    """
    A generator that generates an infinite sequence of numbers.
    
    Yields:
        The next number in the sequence.
    """

    i = 0
    while True:
        yield i
        i += 1

seq = infinite_sequence()
for _ in range(10):

The provided code covers several topics in Python programming, including decorators, generators, and examples of how to use them.

Here's a breakdown of the different sections:

### Decorators

Decorators are functions that wrap around other functions. The main idea behind decorators is to extend the behavior of the original function without permanently modifying it.

- **Basic Decorator Example**: This example shows a simple decorator that prints before and after calling a function.
- **Decorator with Argument Example**: This example demonstrates a decorator that measures the execution time of a function.
- **Decorator with Default Argument Example**: This example illustrates a decorator that prints debug information if in debug mode.

### Generators

Generators are functions that can be used to generate sequences of values instead of computing them all at once and returning them in a list. They use the `yield` keyword to produce output.

- **Basic Generator Example**: This example shows how to create a generator that generates Fibonacci numbers.
- **Generator with `yield from`**: This section explains how generators can be used with the `yield from` statement to flatten lists of generators into a single generator.
- **Generator with `tuple` and `list`**: This section demonstrates using generators to work with tuples and lists, showing how to create them and convert between different data types.
- **Generator with `next` Function**: This example shows an infinite sequence generated by a generator function.

The code is well-explained, and it includes many useful examples. It covers various aspects of decorators and generators in Python and provides good documentation for each section.
