Text-based chatbots are a type of computer program that mimics human conversation by exchanging text messages with humans. They are typically designed to provide customer service, answer frequently asked questions, or help users with specific tasks. Text-based chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user inputs.

There are several types of text-based chatbots, including:

1. Rule-based chatbots: These chatbots use pre-defined rules to generate responses based on user inputs. They are simple and easy to create but may not be able to handle complex or unexpected situations.
2. Machine learning chatbots: These chatbots use machine learning algorithms to learn from user interactions and improve their responses over time. They can handle a wide range of inputs and can adapt to different conversations.
3. Hybrid chatbots: These chatbots combine rule-based and machine learning approaches to provide more flexible and personalized interactions.

The advantages of text-based chatbots include:

1. Cost-effective: Text-based chatbots are relatively low-cost to implement and maintain compared to voice-based chatbots or other interactive technologies.
2. Scalable: Text-based chatbots can handle a large number of users and interactions without significant resources.
3. Flexible: Text-based chatbots can be easily integrated into various platforms and applications, making them a versatile tool for businesses.
4. Accessible: Text-based chatbots are accessible to users with disabilities, as they do not require the use of voice or other assistive technologies.

However, text-based chatbots also have some limitations, including:

1. Limited natural language understanding: Text-based chatbots may struggle to understand complex or ambiguous user inputs, leading to misunderstandings or incorrect responses.
2. Limited personalization: While text-based chatbots can learn from user interactions and improve over time, they may not be able to provide the same level of personalized recommendations or advice as human customer service agents.
3. Dependence on data quality: The accuracy and relevance of chatbot responses depend on the quality and availability of the data used to train them.

Overall, text-based chatbots offer a convenient, cost-effective, and scalable solution for providing customer service and support. However, their limitations should be considered when evaluating their effectiveness in specific applications.

Text-based chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to provide cost-effective and accessible solutions for businesses looking to improve their customer service capabilities. These chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user inputs, making them a versatile tool for businesses of all sizes.

There are several types of text-based chatbots available, including rule-based chatbots, machine learning chatbots, and hybrid chatbots. Rule-based chatbots use pre-defined rules to generate responses based on user inputs, while machine learning chatbots learn from user interactions and improve their responses over time. Hybrid chatbots combine these approaches to provide more flexible and personalized interactions.

One of the main advantages of text-based chatbots is their cost-effectiveness. Unlike voice-based chatbots or other interactive technologies, text-based chatbots are relatively low-cost to implement and maintain. They also offer scalability, as they can handle a large number of users and interactions without significant resources. Additionally, text-based chatbots are flexible and can be easily integrated into various platforms and applications, making them a versatile tool for businesses.

However, text-based chatbots also have some limitations. One of the main challenges is limited natural language understanding. Text-based chatbots may struggle to understand complex or ambiguous user inputs, leading to misunderstandings or incorrect responses. Additionally, while text-based chatbots can learn from user interactions and improve over time, they may not be able to provide the same level of personalized recommendations or advice as human customer service agents.

Another limitation of text-based chatbots is dependence on data quality. The accuracy and relevance of chatbot responses depend on the quality and availability of the data used to train them. Therefore, it is important for businesses to ensure that their chatbots have access to high-quality training data in order to provide accurate and relevant responses.

Despite these limitations, text-based chatbots offer a valuable solution for providing customer service and support. They can be used in a variety of applications, from e-commerce platforms to customer service centers, and are accessible to users with disabilities. Overall, the advantages of text-based chatbots make them an attractive option for businesses looking to improve their customer service capabilities without breaking the bank.

Text-based chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to provide cost-effective and accessible solutions for businesses looking to improve their customer service capabilities. These chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user inputs, making them a versatile tool for businesses of all sizes.

One of the main advantages of text-based chatbots is their cost-effectiveness. Unlike voice-based chatbots or other interactive technologies, text-based chatbots are relatively low-cost to implement and maintain. They also offer scalability, as they can handle a large number of users and interactions without significant resources. Additionally, text-based chatbots are flexible and can be easily integrated into various platforms and applications, making them a versatile tool for businesses.

However, text-based chatbots also have some limitations. One of the main challenges is limited natural language understanding. Text-based chatbots may struggle to understand complex or ambiguous user inputs, leading to misunderstandings or incorrect responses. Additionally, while text-based chatbots can learn from user interactions and improve over time, they may not be able to provide the same level of personalized recommendations or advice as human customer service agents.

Another limitation of text-based chatbots is dependence on data quality. The accuracy and relevance of chatbot responses depend on the quality and availability of the data used to train them. Therefore, it is important for businesses to ensure that their chatbots have access to high-quality training data in order to provide accurate and relevant responses.

Despite these limitations, text-based chatbots offer a valuable solution for providing customer service and support. They can be used in a variety of applications, from e-commerce platforms to customer service centers, and are accessible to users with disabilities. Overall, the advantages of text-based chatbots make them an attractive option for businesses looking to improve their customer service capabilities without breaking the bank.

Text-based chatbots have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to provide cost-effective and accessible solutions for businesses looking to improve their customer service capabilities. These chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user inputs, making them a versatile tool for businesses of all sizes.

One of the main advantages of text-based chatbots is their cost-effectiveness. Unlike voice-based chatbots or other interactive technologies, text-based chatbots are relatively low-cost to implement and maintain. They also offer scalability, as they can handle a large number of users and interactions without significant resources. Additionally, text-based chatbots are flexible and can be easily integrated into various platforms and applications, making them a versatile tool for businesses.

However, text-based chatbots also have some limitations. One of the main challenges is limited natural language understanding. Text-based chatbots may struggle to understand complex or ambiguous user inputs, leading to misunderstandings or incorrect responses. Additionally, while text-based chatbots can learn from user interactions and improve over time, they may not be able to provide the same level of personalized recommendations or advice as human customer service agents.

Another limitation of text-based chatbots is dependence on data quality. The accuracy and relevance of chatbot responses depend on the quality and availability of the data used to train them. Therefore, it is important for businesses to ensure that their chatbots have access to high-quality training data in order to provide accurate and relevant responses.

Despite these limitations, text-based chatbots offer a valuable solution for providing customer service and support. They can be used in a variety of applications, from e-commerce platforms to customer service centers, and are accessible to users with disabilities. Overall, the advantages of text-based chatbots make them an attractive option for businesses looking to improve their customer service capabilities without breaking the bank.

Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
