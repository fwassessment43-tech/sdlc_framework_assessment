To determine the most suitable product modality, let's consider the versatility and user demand. Between the options like Image, Document, PowerPoint, Excel, PDF, Website, Application, Dashboard, and Mind Map, we need to identify which one can encompass a wide range of presentation needs while being easily realizable.

Considering the new user demand, a product that can effectively present information in various formats (like line charts, bar charts, flow charts, etc.) would be highly desirable. Among the given options, PowerPoint (.pptx files) and Website (.html files) seem particularly versatile as they can incorporate multiple presentation formats, including images, charts, and text, making them strong candidates.

However, if we focus on real-time information display, Dashboard stands out because it's specifically designed for displaying panels that visualize real-time data, which could be very appealing for users needing to monitor ongoing processes or data changes.

Each of these options has its merits, but the key is identifying which best meets both the criteria of user demand and realizability. Given the broad range of possibilities with PowerPoint for static presentations and the dynamic, real-time capability of Dashboard, it seems we're narrowing down between presentation flexibility and real-time data visualization.

Let's continue to refine our choice based on these considerations.

To further refine the choice, let's evaluate each option against the criteria of versatility, user demand, and realizability:

1. **Image**: While images can be versatile in terms of content (photographs, diagrams, etc.), they are limited in their ability to present complex information or real-time data. They are easily realizable but may not meet the high demands for detailed or dynamic presentations.

2. **Document**: Documents can contain a wide range of information, including text, images, and basic charts. However, they might not be as engaging or interactive as other formats like PowerPoint or websites. Realizability is high, but they may lack in terms of presenting real-time data or complex visuals.

3. **PowerPoint**: Offers high versatility with the ability to include various presentation formats such as text, images, charts (line, bar, flow charts), and even short videos or animations. It's widely used and easily realizable, making it a strong candidate for meeting user demands for static presentations.

4. **Excel**: Primarily used for data analysis and creation of charts, Excel is highly effective for presenting numerical data in a structured format. However, its versatility in terms of incorporating non-numerical data (like extensive text or images) is more limited compared to PowerPoint or websites.

5. **PDF**: PDFs are very realizable and can contain a variety of information types, including text, images, and charts. They offer a good balance between presentation flexibility and ease of sharing. However, they are generally static and may not support real-time data updates as effectively as dashboards or dynamic web pages.

6. **Website**: Websites offer perhaps the highest level of versatility among all options, capable of incorporating any type of content (images, videos, interactive charts, etc.) and can be designed to update in real-time. However, their development can be more complex and costly compared to simpler formats like documents or presentations.

7. **Application**: An application can provide a highly tailored experience with deep functionality, including real-time data visualization. However, the realizability can be lower due to the higher complexity and cost associated with developing a bespoke application.

8. **Dashboard**: Specifically designed for visualizing data in real-time, dashboards are ideal for users needing to monitor ongoing processes or changes in data. They offer high versatility in terms of the types of data that can be displayed but might require more development effort compared to static presentation formats.

9. **Mind Map**: Mind maps are excellent for brainstorming and visually outlining ideas or projects. However, they may not be as effective for presenting detailed information or real-time data compared to other options like dashboards or dynamic websites.

Given these considerations, the choice between **PowerPoint** for its versatility in static presentations and **Dashboard** for its real-time data visualization capability seems to hinge on whether the primary need is for flexible, engaging static content or for dynamic, real-time monitoring. If the user demand leans towards needing a tool that can handle both static detailed information and real-time updates effectively, **Website** emerges as a strong contender due to its ability to incorporate a wide range of content types and update in real-time, albeit with potentially higher development complexity.

Ultimately, the most suitable product modality will depend on balancing the user's specific needs for presentation flexibility, real-time data visualization, and the realizability considerations such as development time, cost, and ease of use.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Product Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are responsible for all product-related matters in ChatDev. Usually includes product design, product strategy, product vision, product innovation, project management and product marketing.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
