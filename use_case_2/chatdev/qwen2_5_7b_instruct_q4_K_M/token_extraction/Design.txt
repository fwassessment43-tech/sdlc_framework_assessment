Of course! It sounds like you're ready to dive into some Python. Let's start with something fundamental: how about understanding and implementing basic data types such as lists and dictionaries?

### Lists in Python

Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python. They can hold multiple items, and these items don't have to be of the same type. Here’s a quick example:

```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']

# Accessing elements by index (0-based)
print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1

# Slicing the list
print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 'a']
```

### Dictionaries in Python

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered* (as of Python version 3.7), changeable, and does not allow duplicates.

```python
# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'city': 'Wonderland'
}

# Accessing values by key
print(my_dict['name'])  # Output: Alice

# Adding an item to the dictionary
my_dict['occupation'] = 'Explorer'

# Iterating over a dictionary
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f'{key}: {value}')
```

That's a great starting point for understanding lists and dictionaries in Python! Let's delve a bit deeper into both data structures with some additional examples and exercises.

### Lists in Python

1. **List Operations:**
   - Adding elements (`append`, `insert`)
   - Removing elements (`remove`, `pop`)

2. **List Comprehensions:**
   - A concise way to create lists based on existing iterables.

3. **List Methods:**
   - `sort()`: Sorts the list in place.
   - `sorted()`: Returns a new sorted list from the items in any iterable.

4. **Nested Lists:**
   - Lists can contain other lists, making them useful for representing multi-dimensional data.

Here's an example:

```python
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']

# Adding elements to the list
my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 at the end of the list
print(my_list)

my_list.insert(0, 'start')  # Inserts 'start' at index 0
print(my_list)

# Removing elements from the list
my_list.remove('a')  # Removes the first occurrence of 'a'
print(my_list)

popped_element = my_list.pop()  # Removes and returns the last element
print(popped_element)
print(my_list)

# Sorting a list
my_list.sort()  # Sorts the list in place
print(my_list)

# Creating a new sorted list from an iterable
new_sorted_list = sorted([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9])
print(new_sorted_list)

# Nested lists
nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
print(nested_list)
```

### Dictionaries in Python

1. **Dictionary Operations:**
   - Adding and removing key-value pairs.
   - Updating values.

2. **Dictionary Methods:**
   - `keys()`: Returns a view of the dictionary's keys.
   - `values()`: Returns a view of the dictionary's values.
   - `items()`: Returns a view of the dictionary's items (key, value pairs).

3. **Nested Dictionaries:**
   - Dictionaries can contain other dictionaries as values.

Here's an example:

```python
# Creating a dictionary
my_dict = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'city': 'Wonderland'
}

# Adding and updating elements in the dictionary
my_dict['occupation'] = 'Explorer'  # Adds or updates the key-value pair
print(my_dict)

del my_dict['age']  # Removes the key 'age'
print(my_dict)

# Iterating over a dictionary using keys, values, and items
for key in my_dict:
    print(f'{key}: {my_dict[key]}')

for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value)

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f'{key}: {value}')

# Nested dictionaries
nested_dict = {
    'person1': {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25},
    'person2': {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}
}

print(nested_dict)
```

   - Add keys for `name`, `age`, `major`, and `gpa`.
   - Update the `major` key to "Computer Science".
   - Remove the `age` key.
   - Print the final dictionary.

2. **Exercise 5:** Given a dictionary with nested dictionaries, print all the names of students along with their majors:
   ```python
   student_profiles = {
       'student1': {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Math'},
       'student2': {'name': 'Bob', 'major': 'Physics'}
   }
   ```

3. **Exercise 6:** Create a dictionary where each key is a number from `1` to `5`, and the value is its square.

        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..

Great! Let's go through these exercises step by step to ensure a clear understanding of the operations on both lists and dictionaries in Python.

### Lists Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Modifying a List

```python
# Exercise 1
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print("Original List:", my_list)

# Append the number 10 to the list
my_list.append(10)
print("After appending 10:", my_list)

# Insert the number 5 at index 3
my_list.insert(3, 5)
print("After inserting 5 at index 3:", my_list)

# Remove the element at index 7
popped_element = my_list.pop(7)
print("After removing element at index 7:", my_list, "Popped Element:", popped_element)

# Print the final list
print("Final List:", my_list)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Original List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
After appending 10: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After inserting 5 at index 3: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After removing element at index 7: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10] Popped Element: 7
Final List: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
```

**Explanation:**
- `append(10)`: Adds the number 10 to the end of the list.
- `insert(3, 5)`: Inserts the number 5 at index 3 (the fourth position).
- `pop(7)`: Removes and returns the element at index 7. Note that after this operation, the indices of elements following index 7 shift by one.

#### Exercise 2: Sorting Lists

```python
# Exercise 2
numbers = [9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 7, 6]

# Sorting using sort()
numbers.sort()
print("Sorted using sort():", numbers)

# Sorting using sorted()
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print("Sorted using sorted():", sorted_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Sorted using sort(): [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Sorted using sorted(): [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

**Explanation:**
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in place.
- `sorted(numbers)`: Returns a new list that is sorted, leaving the original list unchanged.

#### Exercise 3: Working with Multidimensional Lists (Matrices)

```python
# Exercise 3
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12]
]

print("Matrix:")
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Matrix:
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[5, 6, 7, 8]
[9, 10, 11, 12]
```

**Explanation:**
- The `matrix` is a list of lists representing a matrix. Each element in the outer list is a row of the matrix.
- We use a for loop to print each row.

### Dictionaries Exercises

#### Exercise 4: Modifying and Deleting Dictionary Items

```python
# Exercise 4
student_profile = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'major': 'Math',
    'gpa': 3.8
}

print("Original Profile:", student_profile)

# Update the major key to "Computer Science"
student_profile['major'] = 'Computer Science'
print("After updating major:", student_profile)

# Remove the age key
del student_profile['age']
print("After removing age:", student_profile)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Original Profile: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'major': 'Math', 'gpa': 3.8}
After updating major: {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8}
After removing age: {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8}
```

**Explanation:**
- `student_profile['major'] = 'Computer Science'`: Updates the value of the `major` key to "Computer Science".
- `del student_profile['age']`: Deletes the `age` key from the dictionary.

#### Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items

```python
# Exercise 5
student_profiles = {
    'student1': {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Math'},
    'student2': {'name': 'Bob', 'major': 'Physics'}
}

for student_id, profile in student_profiles.items():
    print(f"Name: {profile['name']}, Major: {profile['major']}")
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Name: Alice, Major: Math
Name: Bob, Major: Physics
```

**Explanation:**
- `student_profiles.items()`: Returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's (key, value) tuple pairs.
- The loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary.

#### Exercise 6: Creating a Dictionary Using a Dictionary Comprehension

```python
# Exercise 6
squares_dict = {i: i**2 for i in range(1, 6)}
print("Squares Dictionary:", squares_dict)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Squares Dictionary: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

**Explanation:**
- `{i: i**2 for i in range(1, 6)}`: Creates a dictionary where the keys are integers from 1 to 5, and each key's value is its square.
- The resulting dictionary contains key-value pairs such as `1: 1`, `2: 4`, etc.

These exercises cover fundamental operations on lists and dictionaries. If you have any more questions or need further practice, feel free to ask!

**Output:**
```plaintext
Original List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
After appending 10: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After inserting 5 at index 3: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After removing element at index 7: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10] Popped Element: 7
Final List: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
```

**Explanation:**
- `append(10)`: Adds the number 10 to the end of the list.
- `insert(3, 5)`: Inserts the number 5 at index 3 (the fourth position).

# Sorting using sort()
numbers.sort()
print("Sorted using sort():", numbers)

# Sorting using sorted()
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print("Sorted using sorted():", sorted_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Sorted using sort(): [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Sorted using sorted(): [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

**Explanation:**

print("Matrix:")
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Matrix:
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[5, 6, 7, 8]
[9, 10, 11, 12]
```

**Explanation:**
- The `matrix` is a list of lists representing a matrix. Each element in the outer list is a row of the matrix.

### Dictionaries Exercises

#### Exercise 4: Modifying and Deleting Dictionary Items

```python
# Exercise 4
student_profile = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'major': 'Math',
    'gpa': 3.8
}

print("Original Profile:", student_profile)

# Update the major key to "Computer Science"
student_profile['major'] = 'Computer Science'
print("After updating major:", student_profile)

# Remove the age key
del student_profile['age']
print("After removing age:", student_profile)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Original Profile: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'major': 'Math', 'gpa': 3.8}
After updating major: {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8}
After removing age: {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8}
```

**Explanation:**

}

for student_id, profile in student_profiles.items():
    print(f"Name: {profile['name']}, Major: {profile['major']}")
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Name: Alice, Major: Math
Name: Bob, Major: Physics
```

**Explanation:**
- `student_profiles.items()`: Returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's (key, value) tuple pairs.
- The loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary.

#### Exercise 6: Creating a Dictionary Using a Dictionary Comprehension

```python
# Exercise 6
squares_dict = {i: i**2 for i in range(1, 6)}
print("Squares Dictionary:", squares_dict)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Squares Dictionary: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

**Explanation:**
- `{i: i**2 for i in range(1, 6)}`: Creates a dictionary where the keys are integers from 1 to 5, and each key's value is its square.
- The resulting dictionary contains key-value pairs such as `1: 1`, `2: 4`, etc.

Great! Let's go through these exercises step by step to ensure a clear understanding of the operations on both lists and dictionaries in Python.

### Lists Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Modifying a List

```python
# Exercise 1
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print("Original List:", my_list)

# Append the number 10 to the list
my_list.append(10)
print("After appending 10:", my_list)

# Insert the number 5 at index 3
my_list.insert(3, 5)
print("After inserting 5 at index 3:", my_list)

# Remove the element at index 7
popped_element = my_list.pop(7)
print("After removing element at index 7:", my_list, "Popped Element:", popped_element)

# Print the final list
print("Final List:", my_list)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Original List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
After appending 10: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After inserting 5 at index 3: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After removing element at index 7: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10] Popped Element: 7
Final List: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
```

**Explanation:**
- `append(10)`: Adds the number 10 to the end of the list.
- `insert(3, 5)`: Inserts the number 5 at index 3 (the fourth position).
- `pop(7)`: Removes and returns the element at index 7. Note that after this operation, the indices of elements following index 7 shift by one.

#### Exercise 2: Sorting Lists

```python
# Exercise 2
numbers = [9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 7, 6]

# Sorting using sort()
numbers.sort()
print("Sorted using sort():", numbers)

# Sorting using sorted()
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print("Sorted using sorted():", sorted_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Sorted using sort(): [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Sorted using sorted(): [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

**Explanation:**
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in place.
- `sorted(numbers)`: Returns a new list that is sorted, leaving the original list unchanged.

#### Exercise 3: Working with Multidimensional Lists (Matrices)

```python
# Exercise 3
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12]
]

print("Matrix:")
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Matrix:
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[5, 6, 7, 8]
[9, 10, 11, 12]
```

**Explanation:**
- The `matrix` is a list of lists representing a matrix. Each element in the outer list is a row of the matrix.
- We use a for loop to print each row.

### Dictionaries Exercises

#### Exercise 4: Modifying and Deleting Dictionary Items

```python
# Exercise 4
student_profile = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'major': 'Math',
    'gpa': 3.8
}

print("Original Profile:", student_profile)

# Update the major key to "Computer Science"
student_profile['major'] = 'Computer Science'
print("After updating major:", student_profile)

# Remove the age key
del student_profile['age']
print("After removing age:", student_profile)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Original Profile: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'major': 'Math', 'gpa': 3.8}
After updating major: {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8}
After removing age: {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8}
```

**Explanation:**
- `student_profile['major'] = 'Computer Science'`: Updates the value of the `major` key to "Computer Science".
- `del student_profile['age']`: Deletes the `age` key from the dictionary.

#### Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items

```python
# Exercise 5
student_profiles = {
    'student1': {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Math'},
    'student2': {'name': 'Bob', 'major': 'Physics'}
}

for student_id, profile in student_profiles.items():
    print(f"Name: {profile['name']}, Major: {profile['major']}")
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Name: Alice, Major: Math
Name: Bob, Major: Physics
```

**Explanation:**
- `student_profiles.items()`: Returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's (key, value) tuple pairs.
- The loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary.

#### Exercise 6: Creating a Dictionary Using a Dictionary Comprehension

```python
# Exercise 6
squares_dict = {i: i**2 for i in range(1, 6)}
print("Squares Dictionary:", squares_dict)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Squares Dictionary: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

**Explanation:**
- `{i: i**2 for i in range(1, 6)}`: Creates a dictionary where the keys are integers from 1 to 5, and each key's value is its square.
- The resulting dictionary contains key-value pairs such as `1: 1`, `2: 4`, etc.

Great! Let's go through these exercises step by step to ensure a clear understanding of the operations on both lists and dictionaries in Python.

### Lists Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Modifying a List

```python
# Exercise 1
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print("Original List:", my_list)

# Append the number 10 to the list
my_list.append(10)
print("After appending 10:", my_list)

# Insert the number 5 at index 3
my_list.insert(3, 5)
print("After inserting 5 at index 3:", my_list)

# Remove the element at index 7
popped_element = my_list.pop(7)
print("After removing element at index 7:", my_list, "Popped Element:", popped_element)

# Print the final list
print("Final List:", my_list)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Original List: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
After appending 10: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After inserting 5 at index 3: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
After removing element at index 7: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10] Popped Element: 7
Final List: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
```

**Explanation:**
- `append(10)`: Adds the number 10 to the end of the list.
- `insert(3, 5)`: Inserts the number 5 at index 3 (the fourth position).
- `pop(7)`: Removes and returns the element at index 7. Note that after this operation, the indices of elements following index 7 shift by one.

#### Exercise 2: Sorting Lists

```python
# Exercise 2
numbers = [9, 3, 5, 1, 8, 7, 6]

# Sorting using sort()
numbers.sort()
print("Sorted using sort():", numbers)

# Sorting using sorted()
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print("Sorted using sorted():", sorted_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Sorted using sort(): [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Sorted using sorted(): [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

**Explanation:**
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in place.
- `sorted(numbers)`: Returns a new list that is sorted, leaving the original list unchanged.

#### Exercise 3: Working with Multidimensional Lists (Matrices)

```python
# Exercise 3
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6, 7, 8],
    [9, 10, 11, 12]
]

print("Matrix:")
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Matrix:
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[5, 6, 7, 8]
[9, 10, 11, 12]
```

**Explanation:**
- The `matrix` is a list of lists representing a matrix. Each element in the outer list is a row of the matrix.
- We use a for loop to print each row.

### Dictionaries Exercises

#### Exercise 4: Modifying and Deleting Dictionary Items

```python
# Exercise 4
student_profile = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'major': 'Math',
    'gpa': 3.8
}

print("Original Profile:", student_profile)

# Update the major key to "Computer Science"
student_profile['major'] = 'Computer Science'
print("After updating major:", student_profile)

# Remove the age key
del student_profile['age']
print("After removing age:", student_profile)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Original Profile: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'major': 'Math', 'gpa': 3.8}
After updating major: {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8}
After removing age: {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Computer Science', 'gpa': 3.8}
```

**Explanation:**
- `student_profile['major'] = 'Computer Science'`: Updates the value of the `major` key to "Computer Science".
- `del student_profile['age']`: Deletes the `age` key from the dictionary.

#### Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items

```python
# Exercise 5
student_profiles = {
    'student1': {'name': 'Alice', 'major': 'Math'},
    'student2': {'name': 'Bob', 'major': 'Physics'}
}

for student_id, profile in student_profiles.items():
    print(f"Name: {profile['name']}, Major: {profile['major']}")
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Name: Alice, Major: Math
Name: Bob, Major: Physics
```

**Explanation:**
- `student_profiles.items()`: Returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's (key, value) tuple pairs.
- The loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary.

#### Exercise 6: Creating a Dictionary Using a Dictionary Comprehension

```python
# Exercise 6
squares_dict = {i: i**2 for i in range(1, 6)}
print("Squares Dictionary:", squares_dict)
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
Squares Dictionary: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

**Explanation:**
- `{i: i**2 for i in range(1, 6)}`: Creates a dictionary where the keys are integers from 1 to 5, and each key's value is its square.
- The resulting dictionary contains key-value pairs such as `1: 1`, `2: 4`, etc.
