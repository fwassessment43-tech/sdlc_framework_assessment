You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]


Based on your provided test report, there are several issues with your code that need to be addressed:

1. The `AttributeError` in line 8 of `main.py` is caused by the fact that you have not defined a `setup()` function in the `gui.py` module. You should define this function in the `Gui` class to set up the GUI layout and add widgets to it.
2. The `AttributeError` in line 4 of `main.py` is caused by the fact that you have not defined a `start()` function in the `gui.py` module. You should define this function in the `Gui` class to start the application.
3. The `NameError` in line 10 of `loginpage.py` is caused by the fact that you are trying to access a variable `username_entry` that does not exist. You should replace `username_entry` with `self.username_entry` to refer to the username entry widget defined in the `LoginPage` class.
4. The `NameError` in line 10 of `user_management.py` is caused by the fact that you are trying to access a variable `password_entry` that does not exist. You should replace `password_entry` with `self.password_entry` to refer to the password entry widget defined in the `UserManagement` class.
5. The `NameError` in line 10 of `ticket_management.py` is caused by the fact that you are trying to access a variable `ticket_list` that does not exist. You should replace `ticket_list` with `self.ticket_list` to refer to the ticket list widget defined in the `TicketManagement` class.
6. The `NameError` in line 10 of `helpdesk_staff_page.py` is caused by the fact that you are trying to access a variable `staff_entry` that does not exist. You should replace `staff_entry` with `self.staff_entry` to refer to the staff entry widget defined in the `HelpDeskStaffPage` class.
7. The `NameError` in line 10 of `helpdesk_staff_page.py` is caused by the fact that you are trying to access a variable `submit_button` that does not exist. You should replace `submit_button` with `self.submit_button` to refer to the submit button widget defined in the `HelpDeskStaffPage` class.
8. The `NameError` in line 10 of `helpdesk_staff_page.py` is caused by the fact that you are trying to access a variable `final_page` that does not exist. You should replace `final_page` with `self.final_page` to refer to the final page widget defined in the `HelpDeskStaffPage` class.

To fix these issues, you should define the missing functions and variables in your code and make sure that they are accessed correctly within the classes. Additionally, you may want to consider using a consistent naming convention throughout your code to avoid confusion and errors.

Based on your test report, there are several bugs in your source codes that are causing the issue:

1. In `main.py`, you are calling `gui.setup()` but there is no such function defined in the `gui` module. This results in an error because Python does not recognize the `setup` function.
2. Similarly, in `main.py`, you are calling `gui.start()` but there is no such function defined in the `gui` module. This results in another error because Python does not recognize the `start` function.
3. In `gui.py`, you are defining a class called `Gui` that inherits from `tkinter.Frame`. However, you are not actually creating an instance of this class anywhere in your code. As a result, when you try to call `self.mainloop()` in the `__init__` method of `Gui`, Python raises an error because it is trying to call a non-existent function.
4. In `user_management.py`, you are using `self.parent.show_ticket_page()` and `self.parent.show_helpdesk_staff_page()` but these methods are not defined in the `Gui` class that you created in `gui.py`. As a result, Python raises an error because it is trying to call methods that do not exist.
5. In `ticket_management.py`, you are using `self.parent.show_final_page()` but this method is not defined in the `Gui` class that you created in `gui.py`. As a result, Python raises an error because it is trying to call a non-existent function.

To fix these bugs, you need to define the missing functions and methods in your source codes. Additionally, you may want to consider adding more documentation and comments to your code to make it easier for others to understand and maintain.
