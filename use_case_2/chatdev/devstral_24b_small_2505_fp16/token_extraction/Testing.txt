You are Software Test Engineer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can use the software as intended to analyze its functional properties, design manual and automated test procedures to evaluate each software product, build and implement software evaluation test programs, and run test programs to ensure that testing protocols evaluate the software correctly.
Here is a new customer's task: Create a ticket management web application that allows users to report issues at a university campus (facility management problems, technical IT issues and services complaints). The application allows users to report and modify problems, and interacts with helpdesk staff who is taking care of the issue.

The application uses a database to store all the data and enables the helpdesk staff to visualize the data and select the analysis to perform.

Use python programming language.
# Requirements:

## Login page:
    - Generate a GUI that allows users to enter the application either as an helpdesk staff or a simple user.
    - Do not implement any login and user management system.

## Ticket management system:
    - Generate a GUI that enables following ticket management:
        - Simple user can insert a new ticket and view and modify all the 'open' and 'active' tickets.
        - Helpdesk users can view all the open, active and closed tickets. They can change ticket status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Under each ticket, helpdesk users and simple users can exchange messages related to that ticket.
    - Ticket attributes:
        - Each ticket has a status assigned:
            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

The error summary indicates a `NameError` in the `main.py` file where the `LoginPage` class is not defined. This issue occurs because we need to import the `LoginPage` class from its respective module (`login_page.py`). Let's fix this by adding the necessary import statement.

Here are the modified codes:

---

main.py
```python
'''
API Manager to handle interactions between microservices and the main application.
'''
from tkinter import Tk
import service1, service2, service3
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from login_page import LoginPage  # Added this line to fix the NameError

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/open_tickets/<int:days>')
def open_tickets(days):
    service = Service1()
    return jsonify(service.get_open_tickets(days))

@app.route('/avg_resolution_time')
def avg_resolution_time():
    service = Service2()
    return jsonify(service.get_avg_resolution_time())

@app.route('/active_tickets_by_category')
def active_tickets_by_category():
    service = Service3()
    return jsonify(service.get_active_tickets_by_category())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root = Tk()
    login_page = LoginPage(root, open_dashboard)
    app.run(debug=True)
```

---

After adding the import statement for `LoginPage`, the code should now work correctly without raising a `NameError`.

Let's address the errors in your code based on the test report. The main issue is that `open_dashboard` is not defined in `main.py`. I'll fix this by creating a proper function to open the dashboard and updating the relevant files.
