    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

What type of content do you need to convey (e.g., data analysis, a tutorial, a portfolio, a real‑time report, a mind map, or a full application)?
Would you prefer a static format (e.g., PowerPoint, PDF, Word) or something interactive (e.g., Excel dashboard, website, application, real‑time dashboard)?
Is your primary goal to share information visually, provide a downloadable document, or enable user interaction and data exploration?

Great! Let’s start by pinning down exactly what you want to build.
Just pick the options that match your vision (or combine a few), and feel free to add any extra details that you think are important.

---

### 1️⃣ What kind of content do you need to convey?

| Option | Quick‑look example | When to pick it |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Data analysis (tables, charts, insights)** | 📊 Interactive Tableau workbook or Power BI report | You’ve already got the data and want to tell a story with it |
| **Tutorial / how‑to guide** | 📹 Step‑by‑step video + annotated screenshots | You’re training others or documenting a process |
| **Portfolio or case studies** | 🎨 Project showcase, images + project links | You’re presenting work to recruiters, clients, or collaborators |
| **Real‑time report** | 🔴 Live KPI dashboard with live data feeds | You need up‑to‑date metrics (e.g., sales, server health) |
| **Mind map / concept map** | 🧠 Visual web of ideas | You want to explore relationships, brainstorm, or plan a project |
| **Full application** | ⚙️ Web app, desktop tool, mobile app | You need users to interact with a product, not just view data |
| **Other** | 🔄 | Describe what you’re aiming for |

> **Quick tip:** If you’re unsure, pick “Other” and give a brief description – I’ll help narrow it down.

---

### 2️⃣ Preferred format: static vs. interactive

| Format | Typical output | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------------|------|------|
| **Static** | PowerPoint, PDF, Word, static HTML | Easy to share, print‑ready, no tech upkeep | Limited user interaction, not great for dynamic data |
| **Interactive** | Excel dashboard, BI tool, web/desktop app, live chart embed | Filters, drill‑downs, real‑time updates | Requires tech skills, hosting, maintenance |

> **Quick tip:** If you’re sharing with a broad audience that may not have the right software, a static PDF or PowerPoint is safer. For data scientists, analysts, or a technical audience, interactive is usually more impactful.

---

### 3️⃣ Primary goal

| Goal | Why it matters | Best match |
|------|----------------|------------|
| **Share information visually** | You want a compelling, easy‑to‑understand visual story | Slides, infographics, print brochure |
| **Provide a downloadable, ready‑to‑use document** | End‑users need something they can print or store | PDF, Word manual, e‑book |
| **Enable user interaction & data exploration** | You want users to ask questions, filter, drill down | Interactive dashboards, web app, embedded visualizations |

---

### Next steps

1. **Answer the three questions above.**
   You can simply list the options (e.g., “Data analysis” + “Interactive” + “Enable user interaction”).
2. **Add any extra constraints** you have (deadline, budget, skill level, tech stack, audience).
3. I’ll map out the best tools, a high‑level structure, and design suggestions based on your choices.

Looking forward to your reply! 🚀

Hey there! 👋

Sounds like you’re ready to dive in. Whenever you’ve got a first pass of the table (or even just a rough list of what you’d like to include), drop it here and I’ll:

* Flag any gaps or hidden assumptions
* Suggest a lightweight tech‑stack that fits the constraints you’ve listed
* Sketch a high‑level architecture diagram (text‑based or simple diagram link)
* Outline a phased rollout that keeps your MVP on track and your budget in check

If you’re still juggling a bit of the “what’s actually needed” angle, just let me know what you’re aiming for—product type, target users, core pain points, any mandatory tech constraints—and I can help prune the template into something that feels just right.

Looking forward to seeing your version! 🚀

Sure thing! 🎉 Let’s get the scaffolding in place so I can fine‑tune the table and stack for you.

---

### 1️⃣ Quick Info Checklist
Please fill in as many of these as you can:

| Item | What to include | Why it matters |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Product type** | e.g., mobile app, SaaS dashboard, API service, web portal, etc. | Determines tech patterns, UX, and deployment models. |
| **Target users** | Demographics (age, role, industry), org size, any user personas. | Helps prioritize features and choose user‑friendly tech. |
| **Core pain points** | The primary problems you’re solving, top 3 to 5 user‑stories. | Drives the MVP feature set and table fields. |
| **Mandatory tech constraints** | Cloud‑only vs on‑prem, compliance (GDPR, HIPAA), legacy integrations, budget caps, time‑to‑market. | Filters the stack and architecture choices. |
| **Optional but handy** | Expected traffic volume, data volume, geographic distribution, any existing tech you’d like to reuse. | Fine‑tunes scalability & cost. |

---

### 2️⃣ Rough Table / Field List
If you’ve sketched out the data model or a simple list of “what I need to store / display,” just paste it here. Even a bullet list is fine:

```text
- User
- Project
- Task
- Comment
- Attachment
```

Or if you’re unsure, a “high‑level” list of the major entities will do. We’ll shape the exact schema from there.

---

### 3️⃣ How I’ll Help Next
Once I have the above, I’ll:

1. **Spot‑check** the table for missing fields or hidden assumptions.
2. Recommend a **lightweight, budget‑friendly tech stack** (e.g., PostgreSQL + FastAPI + SvelteKit).
3. Draw a **text‑based high‑level architecture diagram** (or provide a link to a quick diagram if you prefer).
4. Outline a **phased rollout** that keeps the MVP lean, iterative, and cost‑controlled.

Feel free to drop whatever you’ve got ready, or even start with “I’m still drafting the big picture” – I can guide you through that too. 🚀

Great! 🎉
Let’s start by getting the high‑level picture nailed down. You can simply copy/paste the table below and fill in the blanks (or jot a few bullet points if you’re still sketching). Once I have those, we’ll:

1. **Polish the schema** – make sure we have all the fields we need, naming conventions, and relationships nailed down.
2. **Choose the right stack** – we’ll pick the most efficient tech combo for your constraints.
3. **Sketch the architecture** – a quick diagram of components, data flow, and deployment.
4. **Plan the MVP** – decide what to ship first and how to iterate.

            - A newly created ticket has the status 'open' assigned by default.
            - Helpdesk users can change tickets status from 'open' to 'active' and from 'active' to 'closed'.
        - Each ticket has a free text description field.
        - Each ticket has an automatically assigned category among the following categories: facility management (e.g.: elevator is not working), technical IT (e.g.: WIFI malfunctioning), services complaints (e.g.: canteen's food complaints)
        - Each ticket has an opening, last modification and closing date attribute.
    - Database:
        - Implement a database to store tickets and users interaction data.
        - Implement all the basic functionalities that a database needs as inserting and modifying data.

## Micro-services architecture:
    - Implement a microservices architecture that interacts with the ticket management application to provide helpdesk users data visualization and analysis functionalities.
    - Interaction with the database should be enabled via API.
    - Implement the following services:
        - Service 1: Allow user to choose the period (last X hours/days). Display the number of tickets opened in the selected period, which have not yet been closed.
        - Service 2: Average ticket resolution time, displayed by the opening month (of the ticket)
        - Service 3: Cluster the tickets by ticket category and display number of active tickets per category..
